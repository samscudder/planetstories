            <h1>WHAT HATH ME?</h1>
            <h2>By HENRY KUTTNER</h2>
            <h3>The thousand tiny eyes raced past him, glittering with alien ecstasy, shining brighter, ever brighter as they fed. He felt the lifeblood being sacked out of him—deeper stabbed the gelid cold—louder roared the throbbing in his ears... then the voice came, “<i>The heart of the Watcher. Crush the heart.</i>”</h3>
