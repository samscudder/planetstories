Illustrated by C. A. MURPHY
SOMEWHERE aboard the Super
Space Liner, Jupiter, a resonant gong sounded three times. Norman Saint Clair started, glanced uneasily about the magnificent lounge. A gray fear gnawed at his vitals. With a sinking heart, he watched the crowd, who had come to see off the passengers, hurry out the port. This was his last chance to get off the ship. “Excuse me,” said a voice at his elbow. Norman Saint Clair spun around, recognized a Universal Lines steward, grinned embarrassedly.
“First trip?” asked the yellow clad steward.
The young man nodded.
“I wouldn’t be too uneasy, sir. We’ll pick up our escort this side of the moon. A full ship of the line, sir. We’re carrying radium, you know. They wouldn’t dare attack a ship of the line. May I see your book, sir?”
Norman Saint Clair fumbled in his wallet, handed the steward his book. Since Terra’s ships had begun to disappear on the Earth to Jupiter run, the Terrestial Intelligence Service required them of everyone traveling through space. It contained his photograph, a three-dimensional likeness showing a gaunt likeable face crowned by short, crisp blond hair, a photostatic copy of his birth certificate, his de-cription, nationality, business, fingerprints, history.
Satisfied, the steward said: “This way, sir,” and led him to an acceleration chair at the after end of the lounge. “Strap yourself in, sir. We start in a few moments.” The young man eased his lank, six-foot-two frame into the seat, nervously fastened
the belt. In spite of the steward’s words, he was not reassured. Ship after ship had vanished into the blue. Nor had the vaunted Terrestial Navy or the T.I.S. been able to discover any trace of them thereafter. Somewhere beyond the orbit of Mars their radios crackled and blanked out. Space opened and swallowed them.
It was unprecedented. Never before in the history of space travel had anything remotely like it occurred.
His eyes roved among the few passengers strapped in their chairs. They were subdued. The sailing, unlike the gay hectic affairs before the coming of the terror, was grim, quiet. No one, he realized, was making the trip unless it was unavoidable.
With a touch of panic, he considered demanding to be set back on Terra while there was yet time, but a stubborn streak made him hold to his course. It was the same stubborn streak which had led him to book passage aboard the Jupiter in spite of the terror. A hundred times he had regretted accepting the post of Lecturer on Ancient History at distant Ganymede. He loved the quiet sanctuary of his library with its collection of twentieth century authors. He had no ambition to exchange ' his secure academic life for the uncertainty of a crude, rowdy frontier. But the post had offered a good salary, much better than he could expect on Earth for years.
A party of Colonial Guards swaggering across the lounge drew his attention. They were a hard-faced lot, recruited from Earth’s far-flunged frontiers. They constituted, he knew, a special armed guard, traveling aboard the Jupiter at the com-

The passengers of the captured ship had been brought to the saloon in whatever
state of undress the ray had caught themv
pany’s request. Universal was taking no risk with the precious cargo of radium.
FROM the Colonial Guards his eyes strayed across to the occupant of the seat next to his. A girl. He stared, lost in admiration. He'd never seen a creature so beautiful. Her black curly hair framed a pale oval face. Her eyes were blue, her features delicate, chiseled. She was, he realized with a start, regarding him with a mixture of amusement and solicitude.
“First trip?'’ the girl asked, liking the frank scholarly face of the young man.
He nodded.
“Just relax in your chair/' she advised him. “The acceleration’s pretty fierce at first/’
A second gong advised them the port was sealed. Several passengers hurried into the lounge, flung themselves into acceleration chairs. A voice, coming over the public address system, announced: “Strap yourselves in carefully. Acceleration begins in three minutes.” Twice more the warning was repeated.
Norman Saint Clair’s pulse beat rapidly. He felt frightened. Then a faint hum made itself felt rather than heard.
The girl said, “Listen, the engines.”
He thought they sounded like the hum of bees on a warm summer day. He shivered, feeling that cold knife of fear slide into his vitals.
A giant hand slammed him in the chest, thrust him deep into the folds of the acceleration chair. His breath was driven from his lungs. He gasped, strained for air painfully. The die was cast, he realized bitterly. There could be no turning back now. They were off.
In a few minutes the pressure slackened. He could turn his head. The girl, he saw, had uncoupled her safety and was rising. Fie followed her example, stood up unsteadily. The artificial gravity, two-thirds that on Earth, was in effect. It gave him a light giddy sensation. He didn’t think he was going to enjoy the voyage.
“Isn’t it delightful?” said the girl. “It always make me feel positively sylph-like.” Now that she was standing he could see how slim was her waist, how full her hips, how long her legs. She stirred some atavistic sense in him. A vein throbbed in
his throat. I’m reacting like an animal, he thought. Disgusting.
The girl held out her hand, said, “I’m Jennifer Scott. I’m going home to Ganymede.”
He took her hand, introduced himself. “I’ve been employed to lecture on Ancient History at the Ganymede Seminar.”
Jennifer clapped her hands. “Grand. Papa is commandant of the military post. The fort is only a short distance from the Seminar. We’ll be neighbors. You’ll love Ganymede. It’s so wild and primitive.” “No doubt,” he replied dryly.
Jennifer glanced at her watch, said, “It’s time for lunch. I’m ravenous. Shall we try the saloon or the grill.” She seemed to have assumed proprietorship of him. He rather liked it. He said, “Let’s try the dining saloon.”
As he piloted her across the lounge, he observed again how few people had booked passage. The fear returned, squeezed at his stomach. He said:
“Do you think it was wise to make the crossing at a time like this?”
“What?” said Jennifer. “Oh. You mean the terror. No, I suppose it wasn’t, and papa will be frantic. He sent me a space-ogram absolutely forbidding me to return. But I was fed up.”
“Fed up?”
“Yes, fed up with Earth and their dull stuffy ways,” said the girl passionately. “They're dead. They’ve forgotten how to play, or fight or make love.”
Norman Saint Clair was shocked. People who went to the Colonies, he had always supposed, were driven to some such drastic step by the force of circumstance —economic, possibly, as was his case. This view came as a revelation, an unpleasant one.
“Anyway,” continued the girl; “we’re off. It’s too late now.”
They fell in behind a fat Earth woman, entered the passage which led to the dining saloon. He started to ask the girl what she had found so unpleasant about Earth, when the fat woman stopped, said: “Oh, my God!” Then she began to scream. The screams lifted the hair right off Norman Saint Clair’s neck.
Jennifer cried, “What is it? What happened ?”
Plesitantly, he peered over the scream-
ing woman's shoulder, saw a man stretched on the deck. He lay on his stomach, his head on one side, disclosing a pale classical profile. He appeared young, little older than Norman himself.
“I don’t know,” the young man replied. “Someone’s hurst, I think.”
He forced himself to push past the fat woman, kneel at the unconscious man’s side. What he saw made him sick. He looked away. A gout of blood had spurted from the man’s neck, dyed the green fi-beron carpet scarlet. His throat had been cut from ear to ear.
SEVERAL passengers, alarmed by the Earth woman’s screams, dashed into the passage.
“What’s wrong?”
“Something happened?”
“Dead!” the fat woman gasped. "My God, I almost stepped on him!” She burst into strangling sobs.
A yellow-clad steward appeared. He couldn’t see the body because of the press. “What’s the trouble, sir?”
Norman stared at him. “Murder,” he said in a shocked voice. “This man has been murdered. His throat’s cut.”
“Murder!” repeated the steward. “I’ll get the captain.” He scuttled off down the corridor. The fat woman went into hysterics.
“Who could have done it?” breathed Jennifer. “Why?”
Norman Saint Clair shook his head. He rose from his knees, feeling weak, shaken. He had never seen a dead man before.
“Here,” said a man brusquely. “I’m a doctor. Let me see that man.” He shouldered to the front, knelt beside the body. Norman Saint Clair relinquished his place with relief.
“Powerful man did that,” the doctor jointed out. “Almost cut his head off.” With a gulp Norman looked away. “Here!” ejaculated the doctor. “Look at this!”
Curiosity dragged his eyes back. The doctor had rolled the body over, turned back the lapel of the dark gray business suit. Norman saw a small green disk pinned to the underside of the lapel. It was about the size of a dime and died out to represent one of Earth’s hemispheres.
Three letters in raised silver stood out on the green surface. “T.IS” he made out.
“An agent of the Terrestial Intelligence Service,” breathed Norman.
The doctor rose, drew a handkerchief, wiped his hands. He was a tall man, almost as tall as Norman, with gray hair. PI is brown eyes sought the young man’s. “Pie must have been working on the terror.”
Norman nodded, thought that it didn’t require any brilliant deduction to guess that. Ninety percent of the T.I.S. force was trying to solve it. The entire resources of the Empire were being drawn upon to uncover the solution. Vital trade was at a standstill, and last week the Nebulae, a crack luxury liner, had disappeared between Earth and Mars with the Martian ambassador aboard. The incident had very nearly severed diplomatic relations between the two worlds.
The doctor bit his lip, frowned, “I wish the Captain would get here,” he said. He glanced anxiously at the gaping crowd, discovered the blue-eyed, black-haired girl by Norman’s side.
“Jennifer!” the doctor exclaimed.
“Hello, Doctor Pequod. I didn’t want to interrupt your examination.”
The doctor’s frown deepened. “Jennifer, what’s your father thinking to let you travel at a time like this? He should realize it’s dangerous.”
“He doesn’t know,” replied Jennifer simply. “Doctor, this is Mr. Saint Clair. Pie’s going to lecture in the Ganymede Seminar.”
Norman shook hands automatically. Although he refused to look at the body his mind persisted in picturing it. He said, “Doctor, do you realize there’s a killer loose among us?”
“What do you take me for? A simpleton?” snorted the doctor.
“But Doctor,” put in Jennifer; “if he was working on the terror, he must have discovered something. Else, why should they have killed him?”
“I’d thought of that,” interrupted Norman. “Do you suppose we’re headed for the same fate as those other ships? We’re carrying radium.”
“Nonsense,” grunted the doctor. “That agent might have been on the trail of smugglers, anything. Oh, here comes the Captain.”
The Captain, a brusque little man who appeared to be in his fifties, glanced briefly at the body, said: “Who found it?
Several passengers pointed out Norman.
“I?” said Norman in haste. “I didn't find it. That—that . . .” He flung his eyes over the crowd in search of the fat woman, but she had been carried to her stateroom. He took a breath, began again. “Miss Scott and I were going to lunch. We were right behind an Earth woman. She saw the body first.”
“You didn’t sec anyone enter or leave this passage?”
He emphatically shook his head.
“Steward!” called the Captain, turning away. “Get this body into the meat box.”
“Yes, sir.” The steward started to go for help.
“Here! Wait a moment. Clear these people out first.”
Norman said to Jennifer, “Let’s get out.” More than anything else, he wanted to get away from that body. His voyage to Ganymede was turning out even worse than he had anticipated.
“Not you,” said the Captain. “I want to see your book.”
Norman could feel the eyes of everyone on him as he handed it over.
THE Captain examined it, looked up into the pale scholarly face of the young man. “No,” he said with a trace of contempt, “I suppose you wouldn’t have seen anything at that. You may go.” Norman flushed, took his book back. A surge of anger welled up inside him at the Captain’s tone. He was of a mind to register a complaint with the company.
“I said you may go,” repeated the Captain.
“I am waiting for Miss Scott,” replied Norman stiffly.
For a moment the two men’s wills clashed. It was the Captain, oddly enough, who yielded. “Very well. May I see your book, Miss Scott?”
Norman felt a sense of triumph as Jennifer passed over her book.
The Captain accepted it, scanned it briefly. “I see your father is Commandant Scott. I know him very well. A capable
man. We need more administrators like him in the Colonies. But Earth doesn’t produce the men she used to. If it weren’t for the Outlanders, the Empire would fall to pieces. Decadency; that’s the sickness of Earth. Be sure to convey my respects to your father, Miss Scott.”
Jennifer smiled, said, “Thank you, Captain.”
“I believe you were with Mr. Saint Clair. Did you seen anyone ahead of you?”
Jennifer frowned in an effort to remember, shook her curly black hair. “I’m sorry, Captain.”
Before he could reply an officer pushed his way into the group. Norman recognized him as the colonel in charge of the Armed Guard.
“Hello, Captain,” said the Colonel. “One of my men just informed me of the murder.” He glanced at the body. “I suggest you close off this corridor and take these people’s names.”
“I’ve done both,” said the Captain tartly. “S’ince you've arrived, Colonel, I can leave the investigation in your hands. Meanwhile this must be reported to the T.I.S. You’ll excuse me, Colonel?”
The Colonel nodded indifferently. He was a small wiry man with cold blue eyes. He requested all three of their books, examined them minutely while the doctor fidgeted and Norman sweated to get away from that still form on the deck. After questioning them again, he took their names in a notebook, dismissed them.
Once in the lounge, Norman lit a cigarette, inhaled it gratefully.
The doctor said, “I prescribe a stiff shot of brandy.”
Norman didn’t drink. He believed alcohol impaired thinking. Nevertheless, he seconded the doctor’s suggestion. Spirits, he decided reluctantly, had their uses.
The murder had riven a crack in Norman Saint Clair’s complacency. His safe world was crumbling about his ears. He recalled the Captain’s charge that Earth was decadent. It was true that more and more Outlanders, men born in the colonies, were grasping power. Could it be possible that in his academic isolation he had missed the real pulse of life.
Jennifer said, “Whatever are you thinking, Norman? Your eyes look as if you were miles away.”
With a start, he realized that the pair of them were waiting for him. “I? I was thinking that—that. Oh bother thinking. Let’s get that drink.”
II
A BOARD the Jupiter day and night Jl\ were artificially simulated. Norman Saint Clair awoke the next morning with a sense of disaster strong in his mind. He rose, stretched, went to the quartzite port. They had picked up their escort during the night.
The Terrestian warship paced the Jupiter silently, grimly. She wasn’t half the size of the colossal liner, but her speed he knew to be fabulous, and he could count a hundred gun ports along her starboard side alone. A lean gray wolf of space, he thought. Nothing could stand up against that brutally efficient machine of destruction. Reassured, he began to dress himself carefully.
In the dining saloon he discovered the girl, Jennifer Scott. She was seated at a table having breakfast with a young man to whom Norman took an immediate dislike although it was possible to see only the back of his head. He felt surprised at himself. He wasn’t in the habit of making snap judgements like that.
Jennifer saw him, waved gaily, beckoned him to come sit with them. The informality of the Outlanders never ceased to amaze him. They brushed aside conventions like cobwebs.
He said, ‘‘Good morning, Miss Scott. I trust yesterday’s tragedy didn’t disturb your rest too much.” There was a touch of resentment in his tone. The girl appeared too buoyant, too vivacious. His own sleep had been wretched.
The girl’s blue eyes were bright. She said, “Not too muchand introduced her companion. “This is Mr. Vermeer. He’s an agent of the Venusian Export Lines.”
Norman observed Vermeer coolly, saw a black eyed, black haired man whose gray coat fit his chunky shoulders too tightly. There was a white scar on his upper lip, another above his right eyebrow. Mr. Vermeer extended his hand without enthusiasm, said, “Sit down, Saint Clair.”
Norman eased his lank frame into the
chair. “Have they caught the murderer,
yet?”
Jennifer shook her head.
“Not likely,” observed Vermeer with scorn. “There was a time wnen it would have been suicide to kill a T.I.S. agent. From Mercury to Pluto Earthmen were known as the scourge of the Universe. But now. Pah! They’ve grown fat and spoiled. The Empire isn’t able to protect its own ships anymore.”
Norman fidgeted angrily. “You’re an Earthman, yourself,” he accused.
“Not I,” denied Vermeer. “I’m of Ter-restial descent, but I was born on Venus. I’m an Outlander.”
A waiter approached, took Norman’s order.
Jennifer leaned forward. “Mr. Vermeer, do you believe this murder has any connection with the terror?”
“I wouldn’t be surprised. I’d say the T.I.S*. agent had stumbled across some information which made it necessary that he be silenced.”
Although that was Norman’s idea he said perversely, “I think you’re making a mountain out of a molehill. The agent was probably on the track of smugglers.”
Jennifer opened her blue eyes in surprise. Vermeer shrugged, turned to the girl, said: “They’re giving a dance tonight. Would you be my partner?”
The girl hesitated, glanced roguishly at Norman who sat stiff-faced. “Thank you, Mr. Vermeer, but Mr. Saint Clair has already asked me.”
Norman’s mouth fell open. He had wanted to ask her but had hesitated because he didn’t know her well enough. His heart leaped now with pleasure.
Vermeer glanced at Norman sourly, excused himself, left the table.
When he was out of earshot, the girl said, “There’s something about that man that doesn’t ring true. I hope you don’t mind me using you as an excuse, Norman. You don’t have to take me.”
“Not take you?” he echoed. “Of course, I’m going to take you. You can’t very well refuse now.” He grinned triumphantly, feeling something of a devil. He rather liked the sensation.
The girl was suddenly serious. “Have you heard the news?”
“News?” I haven’t heard any news.”
‘‘It just came over the radio. The Comet disappeared three days out from Ganymede. She was escorted by a corvette of the Martian Navy, too.”
The Comet, he knew, was a semi-passenger freighter of Martian register. “But the corvette?” he echoed blankly, feeling suddenly a bit frightened and confused.
“It vanished too.” She snapped her fingers. “Just like that. But before they disappeared, they reported three flashes in space dead ahead. Then their signals stopped.”
He opened his mouth.
“Wait,” said the girl. “You haven’t heard it all. The Observatory on Ganymede had them in sight all the time. A short while after the ship’s radio messages stopped coming through, they noticed that the Comet was disappearing just as if she were disintegrating. The disintegration started at the stern and slowly worked forward until the ship was completely gone.” She shuddered. “When I heard the news coming over the caster it reminded me of an old, old story of a grinning Cheshire cat. The cat disappeared tail first until even the grin was gone.”
“Alice in Wonderland,” said Norman mechanically. “That was written by Lewis Carrol, a famous writer of antiquity.”
“What do you think it is ?”
He shook his head. “I’m no scientist, Jennifer. It sounds like atomic disintegration.”
“But why?”
Again he shook his head. His food, he realized, was growing cold. He began to eat mechanically. He thought that if he ever reached Ganymede, he’d never venture into space again.
The girl said, “Vermeer was right about one thing. The Empire’s crumbling. This never could have happened a hundred years ago.” She hesitated, then added with a rush, “I wasn’t going to tell you because I’m not sure, but Mr. Vermeer’s stateroom is next to mine. When I first came aboard and was putting away my things, I noticed a man leave his stateroom. Norman, it wasn’t Mr. Vermeer. I think it was that T.I.S’. agent who was murdered.”
“By Jupiter,” ejaculated Norman, “do you think the T.I.S. man could have been
making an investigation of this Vermeer?” She nodded her head, wide-eyed.
“Have you told the Captain ?”
“No,” said the girl.
“But he should know.”
She shook her head. “He’d think I was imagining things. The passengers have been reporting all sorts of nonsense since the murder. If I could only be sure.” She bit her lip. “Norman, the dance tonight. He’ll be there. We could search his room.”
He looked at her aghast. “Search his room? Me? Suppose he walked in on us?” “We could pretend we’d entered by mistake. My cabin is next door.”
He shook his head. “I still think it should be reported to the Captain.”
“He’d never believe me.”
He glanced at her helplessly. “But. . .” Jennifer rose. “I’ll meet you at the dance tonight. We’ll make sure he’s there first.” He nodded unhappily. When the girl had left he pushed back his plate, called the waiter. “You can take this away,” he said. “I’ve lost my appetite.”
Ill
IN spite of all the preparations by the Stewards Department, the dance was not a success. Everyone drank too much, tried too hard to be gay, but the shadow of the terror hung over the little floating world turning the celebrations tawdry.
Norman and Jennifer were seated at a table against the bulkhead. The orchestra was playing My Maris Done Left For Outer Space while a Martian girl gyrated in a barbaric dance which stirred Norman’s pulse and shocked him beyond measure.
“There he is,” said Jennifer in a low excited voice. “There’s Vermeer now.” The Venusian Export Lines man had just entered the saloon. Norman saw him glance casually about the hall, saunter across to the bar.
“Come on,” said Jennifer. “Let’s get started.”
Norman gulped down a last drink of the brandy, rose from the table. Jennifer took his arm. He could feel her grip tighten. They passed out a side entrance, down a companionway to the deck where Vermeer’s cabin was located. Before the door of 312 they paused.
“This is it,” said Jennifer in a whisper. Norman gingerly tried the door. “It's locked/’ he said with relief. “Let’s get back to the dance.”
“Here,” said Jennifer fumbling in her purse. “Try this. It’s a pass key.”
He stared at the little sliver of metal in consternation. “Where did you get it?”
“I bribed the steward.”
Norman took the key. The door opened easily. Vermeer’s stateroom contained a bunk, desk, two chairs, and a dresser. A spot reading light threw a round beam from the overhead to the desk. A door on the right opened into the bath. There was a second door on the left, but it was closed.
He drew Jennifer inside, closed and locked the door.
“Look through the desk,” he commanded. He went to the closed door, opened it, revealing a closet.
“Look,” he said. “What’s this ?” Jennifer glanced up from the desk. Norman had pulled out a single piece garment with shoes, gloves and helmet attached like a diver’s suit. It was made of a very sheer translucent material resembling oiled silk. A zipper-like fastener raCn up the back. The suit was pale green, even the eye pieces being the same color.
Jennifer shook her head. “I never saw anything like it before. It isn’t heavy enough for a space suit. What do you suppose it could be?”
Norman shrugged, put it back on the rack. He went through the pockets of the remaining clothes, found exactly nothing. From the closet, he turned to the built-in dresser. Again his search was fruitless. “Have you found anything, Jennifer?” The girl shook her head. “Not a thing. Except papers from the Venusian Export Lines. He seems to be an accredited agent of theirs after all.”
“Let’s get out of here,” said Norman uneasily.
Jennifer clutched his arm. “Listen!”
He heard the grate of a key in the lock. He and the girl looked at each other in consternation.
“Quick,” said Norman, struck by an inspiration. He embraced Jennifer clumsily. “Put your arms around me! Hurry! Now kiss me!”
Bewildered but obedient, she held up her
lips. Norman kissed her. He held it until a discreet cough behind them caused them to spring apart guiltily.
Mr. Vermeer was regarding them from the open door, his black eyes sardonic. “Sorry to interrupt,” he said, “but you’ve got the wrong cabin.”
“I know it,” said Jennifer in confusion. “My stateroom’s next door. Silly mistake, isn’t it ?”
“Sorry, Vermeer,” apologized Norman hastily. “Come on, Jennifer.” He led the girl into the corridor. Vermeer closed and locked the door after them.
Jennifer unlocked her cabin, said, “Come in.”
Norman limply followed her inside, collapsed on a chair.
“You were wonderful,” she cried. “I never would have thought of that. It explained everything, even our confusion.”
He began to feel rather proud of himself. He glanced about the girl’s room. It was similar to Vermeer’s except that it was not so tidy. Gauzy white undergarments of finest spun microweb lay on the chairs. He recognized a tiny vial of Venusian perfume on the dresser surrounded by a litter of brushes, mirrors, combs. There was a picture of a tall elderly man in a uniform.
“That’s papa,” exclaimed Jennifer.
“I wish I knew what that suit was used for,” said Norman thoughtfully. “I’ve never seen anything like it before.”
“You know,” said the girl seating herself on the edge of the bed, “you’re not like most Earth men. You’re not stodgy and patronizing. You’re cute.”
He felt ridiculously pleased. He was convinced that he’d never met a more intelligent, a more charming, a more beautiful girl than Jennifer Scott. He said, “I’ve had to revise all my opinions of Outlanders since I met you.”
Jennifer laughed, jumped to her feet. Stooping over, she kissed him lightly. “That’s for a very pretty compliment. Now let’s get back to the dance before I lose all my maidenly modesty.”
IV
BEYOND the orbit of Mars a tension gripped the passengers of the Jupiter. The killer of the T.I.S*. agent remained at large, and the passengers were beginning to
regard each other suspiciously. They were now in the zone where the terror operated. The battle ship had edged in closer. Constant radio contact was maintained between the two vessels.
Norman Saint Clair and Jennifer were on the observation deck in the forepeak. The quartzite dome arched flatly overhead. The chill immensity of space crowded all around them, black infinity pricked with a million blazing suns. It was Norman’s first visit to the observation deck. Jennifer had brought him up.
‘‘There’s Jupiter,” she exclaimed pointing to a large bright star dead ahead. Norman gazed at it, fascinated.
The lookout, a lean spaceman, stirred restlessly, then stiffened. Norman followed his gaze, saw three brief pin pricks of light stab out of the void.
“Look !” He clutched Jennifer’s shoulder, but she had seen the flashes already.
The lookout grabbed the phone, said, “Observation deck reporting, sir. Three flashes two points on the port bow. Yes sir. Two points on the port bow.” He hung up the phone.
Norman and Jennifer exchanged glances.
Jennifer said, “The Comet reported three flashes before she disappeared. It must be a signal?”
Overhead the general alarm rang furiously. A file of Armed Guards poured onto the observation deck, took up their posts. Norman pointed to the battle ship. Its guns were run cut like bared fangs.
“Attention!” blared a voice over the public address system. “All passengers return immediately to their staterooms. Attention! All passengers return immediately to their staterooms.”
“Come on,” urged Norman. “We’d better go below.”
“Do you mind if I stay with you?” asked Jennifer.
“Of course not. I wouldn’t leave you alone, anyway.”
They descended the companionway to their deck, entered Norman’s stateroom. Through his port he could still observe the warship pacing them noiselessly.
He padded back and forth across the fiberon carpet. “I wish I had a dart gun, anything. I feel so helpless.” He went to the door, opened it a crack, peered out. “Jupiter!” he breathed.
“What is it?” cried Jennifer, starting up from her chair.
“Not so loud,” he cautioned. “Come here.”
The girl sprang lithely across the deck. On tiptoe, her body pressed against his, she stared over his shoulder through the inch wide crack.
A strange figure stood back to them at the turn in the corridor, a man clad in loose green coveralls with helmet, gloves and boots attached so that no part of his figure was exposed.
“Vermeer!” breathed Jennifer. “He’s put on the suit we saw in his closet/’
Vermeer remained motionless, half crouched at the end of the hall as if waiting for some signal. A poisoned dart gun was buckled around his waist.
Norman eased the door shut, not allowing it to click, faced Jennifer.
“What is it?” she asked breathlessly.
“I don’t know. But I think we should have reported that suit to the Captain.”
Jennifer sank to the edge of the bed. He looked at her, thought again, how striking was the contrast between blue eyes and black hair. He felt dizzy, said, “Jennifer, do you notice anything?”
“I feel faint!” she gasped.
A numbing sensation spread through his limbs. The room tilted crazily, darkened. He cried, “Jennifer!” and fell forward limply on his face. He wondered vaguely, just before consciousness left him, if he were being disintegrated. Then the blackness of infinite space engulfed him.
WHEN Norman Saint Clair returned
to consciousness, he was still lying face down on the green fiberon carpet. He groped to his feet, swayed groggily. He glanced at the bed. Jennifer was gone.
Shaking his head to clear it of the cobwebs, he staggered to the door. It was locked. He was a prisoner in his own room.
Still something was missing, something intangible. Then he heard the silence. It screamed at him. The soft overtones of the motors were dead. The engines had been stopped.
He sprang to his port hole, glanced out. The bulk of the battle ship floated a little above the wounded Jupiter. His eyes opened
wide in consternation. Half of the warship
appeared to have been sheared off as if by
a giant cleaver. Even as he watched she was slowly disintegrating.
Then he made out dozens of figures swarming over the hull like ants. They were men in space suits, he realized, and they were spraying the battle spacer with a film which no sooner solidified than it became invisible, hiding ship and all. A light absorbent matter, he guessed.
The warship was not disintegrating. She was being coated with a film which absorbed all the light rays and so rendered it invisible. That was the answer to the strange disappearance of the Comet and her escort. He looked closer, realized that the invisible stern of the warship was blocking out a patch of stars.
Above the battleship he saw a port open in space and from nowhere a two man tender was launched into the void. It was uncanny. Then he realized he was looking at the ship of the terror, invisible of course. That was how they had approached their prey without being detected. It was one chance in a million that anyone would notice the momentary blotting out of a star.
“Pirates,” he thought. The word was archaic. It had almost disappeared from the vocabulary. He shuddered. They must have approached unseen, bathed the two ships in a ray which knocked everyone unconscious. The vaunted warship, the pride of the Empire, had been taken without firing a shot.
VERMEER, he thought. Of course, they would need a man aboard to shut down the engines, bring the Jupiter to a stop so they could board her. Vermeer's odd suit must have protected him from the effects of the paralysis ray.
He crossed to his bunk, sat down. He felt strangely indifferent to his own fate, but Jennifer! He clenched his hands until the nails bit into his palms. What were the beasts doing with Jennifer?
Abruptly the door opened. Norman sprang to his feet, saw a strange figure blocking the entrance.
It was a man dressed from head to foot in black. Black trousers were tucked into black boots. Blouse and helmet, all a somber black. His eyes though, were blue, his face clean shaven. He had a dart gun in his hand.
“Come along.” He montioned with the dart gun. “You’re wanted above.” He stepped back, indicated that Norman should precede him.
They went silently along the corridor, the pirate collecting more men from the staterooms on either side. By the time they reached the companion way he was herding ahead of him quite a number of frightened prisoners.
“What are they going to do with us?” asked a fat man beside Norman.
They had reached the companionway.
“Up!” said their guard.
They mounted the stair, came out into the dining saloon.
A scene of wildest disorder burst upon Norman’s shocked gaze. A throng of black clad pirates moved among the passengers who had been routed from all parts of the ship. The missing women, he saw, were huddled in a frightened group at the opposite end of the hall. They had been brought to the saloon in whatever state of undress the ray had caught them; in evening dress, scant undergarments, in gowns and shorts, and one frightened girl, clutching a large bath towel about herself.
Norman was pushed into the group of men. His eyes, though, kept searching for Jennifer. With a sigh of relief, he discovered her at the same time she found him. She waved rather forlornly, and Norman almost dislocated his shoulder waving back.
The fat man said, “Pirates! The effrontery of those rogues. When the Terrestial Navy locates their lair, they’ll blast them to atoms.”
Norman recognized Dr. Pequod at his eblow. The doctor was clad nattily in the hair on his chest and a flaming pair of shorts.
“It’s not so simple as that,” the doctor answered the fat man. “You fail to realize the size of the Universe. Nine tenths of it remains unexplored, unmapped. And how will the Terrestial Navy trail an invisible enemy?”
The fat man blew himself up, said, “The resources of the Empire are unlimited.”
“Sounds good,” agreed the doctor; “but the Empire these days is living on its reputation.”
A crowd of the frightened passengers were gathered about the two men.
“And I’ve a notion,” the doctor went on, “that this is more than piracy. The Empire is crumbling. Some faction may be nibbling at its edges, growing strong from its life blood, the trading lines. Has it occurred to you that with every ship lost, the pirates are that much stronger and we that much weaker!”
“Nonsense/’ retorted the fat man, but his tone had lost conviction.
“Break it up,” commanded one of their guards. “Silence!”
THE main entrance to the saloon had swung open, admitting the strangest creature that Norman had yet seen. It appeared human, but obviously it was not from any known planet. Short and squat, with yellow wrinkled skin, it looked more like a rutabaga than a man. The pirates snapped to attention.
“Jupiter,” breathed Norman. “Is it a
man ?”
Dr. Tequod scratched the shag on his chest. “Odd specimen. Wonder what corner of the Universe it hails from?”
The creature regarded the prisoners without any expression whatever on its parchment-like face. It was clothed in a harness which gave no clue to its sex. With a scrawny hand it beckoned the renegade Earthman who had been directing the operations, said something in a voice too low for anyone to overhear.
The Earthman nodded, turned to the captives. “Every able bodied man between the ages of nineteen and forty, step out,” he shouted. As no one moved, he frowned, said, “In any case your books will be examined and your correct age determined. Get a move on!”
Norman accompanied by perhaps thirty percent of the male passengers advanced into the center of the room.
“That’s far enough,” advised the creature in a high reedy voice.
They halted uncertainly.
“Gentlemen,” said the leader, for such the creature seemed to be; “I am here to offer you a choice of two courses. We are coming into possession of more vessels than we have recruits to man. Consequently, it is our custom to offer all able bodied humans between the ages cf nineteen and forty the opportunity to join us. As a further inducement, the new recruits will share equally in the proceeds of this venture with the regular crew.” He paused. Not a flicker
of expression had marred the creature’s
face.
Norman Saint Clair’s eyes narrowed thoughtfully. A forlorn hope presented itself, if only he had the courage to grasp it.
“Now, gentlemen,” the turnip shaped leader continued; “it would only be fair to give you the opposite side of the coin. You are bound to us for life; not by anything so puerile as an oath. In fact you are at liberty to escape any time,” he paused, “if you can.
“You will be given good quarters and food. Money for any pleasure or vices you wish to indulge will come as your share of the prizes taken. The alternative, gentlemen, which I mentioned at first, is slavery. We also need men and women to work our factories, maintain our living quarters. The fighting men do not work.”
With a faint bow the creature turned on his heel, disappeared as suddenly as he had come.
A low buzz sprang up in the hall as everyone turned to his neighbors, questions tumbling from their lips. The pirates dropped their stiff pose, returned to their duties. The men grouped in the center of the floor shifted uneasily.
Norman bit his lip, frowned. He might be able to protect Jennifer as one of the pirates and eventually escape. He wished he could talk it over with her.
“All right,” said the burly renegade. “How many of you are volunteering? Step forward.”
Norman Saint Clair stepped out of the group. He did it like a man plunges off a high dive, quickly before his nerve departed. Nine of his fellow passengers straggled beside him.
“Is that all, gentlemen?” inquired the pirate. “This is your last chance. Either piracy or slavery. And let me warn you, slaves don’t live an easy life. ’
Twenty-three more men straggled uncertainly around Norman.
“All right,” said the pirate. “The rest of vou can return to your fellows. Baldy! Hey, Baldy!”
A second Earth man strolled across the deck. He was short, older than most of the freebooters.
“Take these men aboard the Rocket ” the first renegade directed. “You know what to do with them.”
Make your-

Baldy grinned, saluted. “Come along, you buccaneers,” he commanded.
Norman caught Jennifer’s eyes. She was staring at him in astonishment. He waved, trying to convey reassurance across the space that separated them. Slowly a flush burned up from the girl’s throat. With a look of scorn, Jennifer deliberately turned her back.
NORMAN gaped after her in consternation. He had expected her to realize that he was joining the pirates in order to help her. He certainly had no ambition to go galivanting through space capturing space ships.
“Hey you,” said Baldy, “move along there.”
Norman jumped, trailed after the new recruits. He would help the girl in spite of herself. He visualized himself standing off a dozen black clad figures while Jennifer boarded a small space craft. Then he tumbled in beside her, wrenched the controls wide open: “You’re wounded,” Jennifer cried. “Norman, I didn’t understand. Can you forgive me ?”
“Hey,” growled the man in front. “For God’s sake, quit tramping on my heels.” They had arrived at the air lock, he saw with a start. Baldy opened the port, revealing a small space tender. They wedged themselves inside. With the pirate at the controls the craft launched into space, speeding toward a shadow which blocked off half the heavens.
A port snapped open in space dead ahead. Norman blinked his eyes. Although he knew this was the pirate’s ship coated with the light absorbent film the sight of an air lock appearing suddenly where nothing had been before was disconcerting. The tender eased into the lock, settled to the deck.
“Here we are, you volunteers,” observed Baldy.
They passed from the lock through a corridor into a large square room. Half of the room was railed off. Behind the railing a man in a black uniform sat working at a desk. It reminded Norman of an employment bureau. The rest of the space was filled with benches set in evenly spaced . rows.
“Sit down,” said Baldy.
The recruits seated themselves nervously.
“You,” said Baldy, indicating Norman.
“Go up to the desk.”
Norman rose, approached the middle aged pirate who sported a spade beard and dark brown eyes.
“Your book,” he said.
Norman handed it over.
“Sit down,” said the man. self comfortable.
“You know, since the T.T.S. has inaugurated these books our jobs have been greatly simplified.” He was making rapid notations on a form. “Lecturer on Ancient
History,”
twentieth century literature, up at Norman, smiled. “I’m an anthropologist myself. Was with an expedition to study the aborgines of Jupiter when the pirates captured our ship.” He closed Norman’s book, dropped it in a drawer.
Now this is serious,” he began in a different, somehow ominous tone. “What I am about to tell you is of the gravest importance. Every recruit is warned once and once only, so take heed.
“When you leave here you will be subjected to a machine which registers your personal wave length, particularly the subtle peculiarly individualistic vibrations emanating from your brain. Those vibrations will be impressed on an indestructible duraloid cylinder and sent to the control station in Behrl. The Dohlmites have devised a machine which can broadcast your death at any time, no matter where you may be. It operates through the wave length of your individual vibration.
“Dohlmites?” echoed Norman.
“Yes, Dohlmites. You saw one aboard your ship. The man who recruited you. They are a race so alien to mankind that we have nothing in common. The Dohlmites are the real masters here. All of us, fighting men and slaves, have had our vibrations recorded and are subject to instant death at the first sign of treachery.
“The Dohlmites can snuff your life out by simply turning a dial. Don’t think I exaggerate. I have seen healthy men drop dead on the streets of Behrl. I have seen the lives of an entire rebellious crew extinguished like candles.”
“But who are these Dohlmites. What are they?” Norman's brain was whirling.
“I think,” replied the ex-anthropologist, “that they are plants.”
"Plants!” ejaculated Norman Saint Clair. “Yes, plants. Flora, not fauna. Their young are green in color. As they mature, ripen, I suppose is the correct word, they turn yellow. When they cut themselves, they bleed green. Sap, don’t you know.” “This Behrl, where is it?” asked Norman. “In Neptune. The planet is hollow. Just a shell. The city of Behrl is on the inside of Neptune.” The ex-anthropologist sat back. “Whatever you do, don’t try to escape. Even if you get away, when the Dohlmites missed you they would simply extinguish you wherever you were.”
Norman’s breath went out of him like air from a burst sack. The full implication of what the ex-anthropologist had revealed broke in his mind like an exploding shell. Gone were his hopes of escaping, and taking Jennifer with him. He was trapped. The net of the Dohlmites was perfect and he and the girl were caught in its meshes. Certainly, he thought bitterly, no human intelligence could have conceived such a devilish plan.
FROM the desk of the ex-anthropologist Norman was led into a small closet where the rays of the fatal machine bathed him from head to foot. Beyond the partition something click-clicked at irregular intervals like a beetle and an ominous scratching recorded his vibratory rate indelibly on the duraloid cylinder.
The machine stopped. The door of the closet opened.
Norman discovered a thick shouldered Martian grinning at him from the entrance.
“That’s enough,” said the Martian in the sibilant accent of the red planet. “You’ve been detailed to my squad.”
As Norman slipped from the closet another recruit took his place. He noticed a low humming.
“The engines?” he asked.
“Yes,” agreed the Martian. “We’re off. Your ships have been coated with the light blanket.”
“Where are they?”
“They’re following us. We’ve put prize crews aboard. It was a rich haul. Radium.” He rubbed his hands together, laughed as if in anticipation of the orgy he would be able to indulge in with his share.
Norman winced. The Martians as a rule were a cosmopolitan and cultured people.
“Don’t judge too harshly,” said the Martian as if reading the young man’s thoughts. “You’ll look forward to the brief time between voyages, too. But I’m forgetting. My name’s Koal. I was a space pilot before I was captured.”
Norman introduced himself.
The Martian grinned, shook hands. “Come along, Earth man, and get your issue. Then I’ll show you your quarters.”
At length they came to a chamber deep within the bowels of the ship. A counter ran along the back wall. A wizened yellow eyed Mercurian took Norman’s measure, piled four changes of the somber uniform on the counter. With quick cat-like movements he added a helmet and boots, slug gun and Dixon Ray rifle. Wide eyed, Norman watched the pile grow. It was a very complete outfit by the time the Mercurian paused.
Staggering under the load Norman and Koal ascended to the sleeping quarters, paused before a stateroom.
“This is your cabin,” said Koal unlocking the door. “Slaves keep it cleaned.” They went inside. “If you let me know the number of your stateroom aboard the Jupiter, I’ll see that you get your personal belongings when we arrive in Behrl.”
The cabin, Norman observed, was similar to the one he had left. He set about stowing away his gear.
“You have a great deal to learn,” said Koal and sat down on the edge of the bunk. “The Dohlmites regard us as dangerous animals. But as long as we obey orders we are left alone.”
“What happens to the prisoners?” Norman asked suddenly.
“They’re sold from the block in the slave market.”
“You mean anyone can buy a slave?”
“Certainly. An agent of the Dohlmites bids a flat hundred notes for each captive. If any of them strike your fancy you only need bid above the hundred notes. Of course when a pretty wench is auctioned off the bidding among the men gets rather wild.”
“Jupiter!” breathed Norman pausing in the act of pulling on his blouse. “Was that right, what the Dohlmite said about the recruits sharing equally with the crew in the loot.”
The Martian nodded. “Half goes to the
Dohlmites. The remaining half is divided among the crew. That includes the cargo, whatever the captives bring on the open market and salvage value of the ships themselves.”
Norman grinned. His first purchase with his share of the prize money would be Jennifer Scott.
The Martian pointed to a silver insignia, a small rocket ship of ancient design pinned to the right breast of Norman’s blouse. “That,” he informed the young man, “is the insignia of your clan. It is important. Never take it off. All the men aboard the Rocket belong to that clan.”
“Why?” asked Norman, puzzled.
The Martian sighed. “There is no law in Behrl, so long as we don’t interfere with the administration of the city. In the Human Colony anarchy reigns supreme. For our own protection, we’ve banded together.”
The Martian rose from the bunk, went to the door. “I’ll leave you to get settled now. We eat at fourteen-hundred.” He opened the door, paused, turned back. “One thing more. Forget about escaping. Dismiss it from your mind. Most of us joined with the same intention that you have. But it’s impossible. There was a Martian, a very good friend of mine, who tried it. He stole a space tender. He got all the way to Mars before he was missed. In sight of the quarters of the imperial guard he dropped dead.” He paused, said, “I’ll see you at fourteen-hundred,” pulled the door shut after him.
Norman Saint Clair sank down on his bunk. Somewhere, there must be a weak link in the Dohlmites armor. He wished he had specialized in botany instead of ancient history. Botany, he thought wildly, horticulture, perhaps there lay the clue.
V
DURING the ensuing days Norman Saint Clair became acquainted with the other members of Koal’s squad. There were nine. Two were Martians, one a Venusian, the rest Earthmen. All of them had been captured by the Dohlmites and had chosen piracy to slavery.
While yet a day from Neptune, everyone began feverishly to pack their gear in anticipation of the landing. Word was circulated when they were passing through the crust. Norman and Koal hurried to the corridor before the port, found it jammed with men. The huge ship settled with a slight jar. They had landed.
“Home,” said Koal. r
With a jolt Norman realized that this was home for him, too. The massive entrance slid aside. The men poured out. Caught in the stream, he and Koal were carried to the runway and down to the floor of the spaceport. He looked around curiously.
The road led between two empty troughs. At least he thought they were empty, until he realized he couldn’t see beyond them. Invisible ships lay in the troughs. Overhead a large pinkish sun flamed unnaturally.
“Come along,” urged Koal. “You’ve the rest of your life for sight seeing.” He led Norman outside the yards to a massive building.
“What’s this?” asked the young man as they passed through the doors.
“Emigration. Here’s where you’ll be assigned living quarters.”
A Mercurian ensconced behind a grill like a bank teller took his name and ship, handed him a slip of paper. On it was printed F12-D234. He looked at it blankly.
The Martian laughed, explained: “F12 is the building. Everyone from the Rocket lodges in the same building. D is the floor, two-thirty-four your apartment number.”
“Oh.”
The Martian laughed again, said “Come along. You’ll get the hang of things soon enough.”
They returned to the street, entered a many storied garage. Here Norman saw hundreds of surface cars parked row upon row. A ramp led up to the next level.
“This is where our cars are stored while we’re on a voyage. We aren’t allowed flying vehicles. Onlv the Dohlmites can use them.”
•r
The Martian went to one of the cars, held open the door. “You’ll want to buy one of these as soon as we’re paid. The slaves manufacture them very cheaply.”
Climbing in beside Norman, Koal pressed a button. The diminutive atomic motor burst into life. They rolled out onto the streets of Behrl.
“When will they auction off the prisoners?” asked Norman as the Martian guided the surface car through the traffic.
%
“Not for a day or so. You’ll be notified. This is the manufacturing district.,,
One factory after another flowed past. Off to their left Norman observed a hill towering above the rest of the city. Its slopes were covered with balconied buildings rank with trees and flowers and shrubs like the fabled hanging gardens of Babylon.
“What’s that?” He nudged the Martian.
“That’s where the Dohlmites live. Whatever you do, don’t go near that quarter of the city. A force wall surrounds it which is instant death if you come in contact with it. Their laboratories, the control station, the death machine, our wave length cylinders are all there.”
In a few moments they had passed through the factory area and into a district of shops, restaurants, amusement centers.
“Who operates these?” he asked.
“Slaves. The profits go to the Dohlmites. Everything returns to their pockets.”
The streets were crowded with people: barefooted women in short gay colored tunics, men in loose coveralls.
“Slaves,” explained Koal.
The vastness of the plant men’s enterprise became apparent as they sped through the streets.
“Koal,” said Norman a little frightened. “When is it going to stop ?”
The Martian looked at him grimly, “With the fall of the Empire,” he replied bitterly. “With the enslavement of Mars and Venus and Earth. The Dohlmites are only a handful, but they plan to lop off the Empire colony by colony, enslaving the inhabitants just as they have us. Their ultimate goal is to have the individual wave recording of every human in the Universe. An Empire of slaves.
“Impossible!” he ejaculated.
“Why? The element of time is of no importance with them. Every ship they capture gives them more power, more slaves. It gathers force like a snowball rolling down hill. Before long, nothing can stop them.”
NORMAN slumped back in his seat.
What the Martian said was true. Unless the Dohlmites were stopped soon, they would be so strong that nothing in the Universe could halt their march to Empire.
“Is there a library in Behrl?” he asked the Martian suddenly.
“Yes,” replied Koal in surprise. “A very fine one in fact, but no one uses it.”
Norman’s next question seemed irrelevant.
“Would the humans revolt if they thought there might be a slim chance of success ?”
“Who would be a slave by choice?” grunted Koal angrily. “They’d rise as one man at the faintest sort of a chance and at no chance at all.” For a moment, he glared straight down the street, then relaxed, glanced at Norman seriously.
“Look,” he said in a quiet voice that was somehow more impressive. “Do you realize how hungry I am for the dry chill air of Mars. How hungry all these exiles are for their home planets? You don’t think we’ve submitted meekly to the Dohlmites, do you? There have been mutinies and rebellions a dozen times since I’ve been here. And every time the rebels have dropped dead on the streets, at their guns, in their beds. All of them. I tell you its impossible.”
“Nevertheless,” said Norman, “you’ve told me what I wanted to know.”
The shops were behind them, many storied apartment dwellings having taken their place. With a grunt, the Martian swung the car down an incline leading to the basement under one of the buildings.
“This is F Twelve,” he said, halted the car just inside the gate while a guard inspected their papers, waved them on.
“For our own protection.” Koal nodded toward the guard as he parked the car. “No one but members of our clan and their households can enter this apartment building.”
They crossed the basement parking area to & lift. Koal pressed a button. The car descended; the doors opened. He motioned Norman inside.
“Hello, Alicia,” Koal greeted the operator, a girl in a short green tunic gathered in at her slim waist by a belt. He chucked her under the chin. “Glad to see me back ?”
She was from Earth, Norman realized. She was barefooted and around her ankle was the metal band of the slave.
She said, “Did you bring me anything?”
He snapped his fingers. “How could I have forgotten?” but his grin belied his words.
Alicia
The girl cried, “What did you bring me, Koal? Where is it?”
“Not so fast,” he admonished. “You haven’t met Saint Clair yet. He’s a new recruit.
The girl turned brown brown eyes on Norman, saw his crisp blond hair and likeable features, his broad shoulders and flat hips. “Um, um,” she said, “I know. You’ve brought me him.”
Norman flushed hotly. The Martian laughed, reached in his pocket, pulled out a pair of earrings set with magnificent Venusian pearls. Norman recollected seeing them grace the ears of a Terranean dowager aboard the Jupiter.
Alicia squealed with delight, hastened to attach the earrings. She shot the lift upward jubilantly.
At D deck they left the car. looked at Norman.
“If you’re lonesome tonight, I’m off duty at Seventeen-hundred.” Before he could answer the doors slid shut.
“What did you do to her?” growled Koal. “I bring the earrings and she propositions you.
Norman grinned, preened himself. Alicia, he decided, was a remarkably pretty girl, intelligent, too.
“Here’s your apartment,” Koal interrupted his thoughts. They had stopped before a door which bore the numeral 234 m brass. “I’m two-forty-eight. If you want anything, step down the hall and knock.” He started off, paused. “Meals are served three times a day in the dining room on A deck, or you can prepare your own food in your rooms. I think you’ll find everything necessary in the kitchen. If not, call the steward.”
Norman went inside, glanced around curiously. An entrance hall led him into a sumptuous living room. A compact kitchen, which did everything mechanically but digest your food, opened from a dinette. Behind the front rooms lay three spacious bedroms, which gave onto a balcony. He opened the glass doors, passed out into the sunshine.
Building number FI2 was on the outskirts of Behrl, and a jungle of riotous vegetation met his eye. The horizon curved up like a bowl before disappearing in rosy mists.
2— Planet Stories—Winter
Here on the inside of Neptune the sun always hung straight overhead. A land of high noon, he thought. The sun beat down on his head. He wondered what kind of phenomenon it was, possibly a ball of liquid fire slowly burning itself out. The resultant high percentage of carbon dioxide in the air might account for the evolution of plants into reasoning creatures rather than mammals.
He returned to the kitchen. The cabinets were stocked with food and he prepared a cold lunch, ate it hungrily. A feeling of contentment stole over him.
He returned to the bedrooms, chose the largest one, stripped and showered and flung himself into the bed. He was immediately asleep.
VI
SOMETIME later Norman was awakened by a rude hand shaking his shoulder.
Koal was grinning down at him. “Wake up,” said Koal. “You’ve been dead to the world for thirty-six hours, and the paymaster’s here.”
Norman sat up, reached for his trousers, which, to his surprise, were neatly hung over the back of a chair. Drawing on his clothes, he went into the kitchen. It had been cleaned, put to rights. Further exploration revealed that his things from the Jupiter had been delivered and stowed away in the closet and built-in bureau. Hordes of people must have trailed in and out of his apartment while he slept. He decided to prop a chair against the knob the next time he went to bed.
The Martian was watching him, an amused glint in his black eyes. “There is a bolt on your door, you know,” he assured the young man.
A subdued buzzing announced a visitor. “That’s probably the paymaster now,” said Koal. He opened the door, revealing a Mercurian with a black satchel in his hand.
The Mercurian said, “Norman S’aint Clair?”
The young man nodded.
“First,” said the Mercurian, opening the satchel, “here are your papers.” He handed him a yellow envelope which contained a book similar to the one the T.I.S.
had issued when he left Earth.
“The individual shares from the Jupiter's cargo,” the Mercurian droned on, “plus the Terrestial warship amount to twenty thousand notes.” He handed Norman a sheaf of yellow bills.
“Roughly,” Koal interposed, “that is equal in value to twenty-five thousand Earth notes.”
“Twenty-five thousand Earth notes!” gasped Norman. “It’s a fortune.”
“Sign here, please,” said the Mercurian, handing him a ledger.
Norman affixed his name in a daze.
“That doesn’t, of course,” added the Mercurian, “include your share from the sale of the slaves. They are to be auctioned off at fourteenhundred.” He snapped shut his satchel, bowed himself
out.
“What time is it now?” asked Norman.
“We’ve time for something to eat before going twelve-hundred.”
The slave market resembled an open-air theatre minus the seats. The same cosmopolitan crowd which Norman had observed on the streets eddied about the block. He caught sight of a figure clad ' in civilian clothes. It was Vermeer, the black-headed Outlander whom he had been sure was instrumental in the Jupiter's capture.
“Who’s that?” he asked the Martian pointing to Vermeer.
“A Venusian Export Lines man. The Dohlmites needed an outlet for much of the material they captured. They established their own line of trading ships under a Venusian register because they are so much less strict on Venus. By the way, keep away from anyone connected with that company. Never talk sedition in front of them. Those men belong to the Dohlmites body and soul.”
Just then the auctioneer, a lean, yellowskinned Venusian, moved to the block. Two men led Pequod from the wings. The flaming shorts were gone. He was clad *in exactly nothing. The doctor stalked to the block, glared at the buccaneers who had clustered around him.
“What am I offered?” began the auctioneer. “A little scrawny but sound and with a heart of gold.”
The free booters cackled.
“A hundred notes,” said the representa-
tive of the Dohlmites dryly. He was seated on the platform with the auctioneer.
“A hundred notes. I’m offered a hundred notes. Who’ll say a hundred and ten-A hundred and five? Going for a hundred notes. Going. Going. Gone!” He cracked his gavel down. Dr. Pequod was led back into the wings.
The next three passengers were pur" chased by the agent of the Dohlmites for the standard one hundred notes. There was some lively bidding for the ex-chef of the Jupiter, who was finally knocked down to a big-bellied pirate. He hauled his prize off with triumph.
Then Norman’s heart jumped. The sixth passenger to be led to the block was Jennifer. She was barefooted, the metal band gleaming about her naked ankle. A cape had been thrown about her erect shoulders.
The auctioneer lifted it off. There was nothing but girl underneath.
“Two hundred notes,” a voice shouted from Norman’s elbow.
NORMAN swung about, recognized
Vermeer, the Venusian Export Lines agent.
“Hello” said Vermeer, “I see you’ve joined us.”
Norman nodded shortly. “So it was you who killed the T.I.S. agent. I suspected it all along.”
Vermeer merely smiled. The auctioneer cried, “Two hundred notes. Two hundred and ten,” as another man bid. “Twenty. Twenty. Thirty.” The bidding was growing lively.
“Three hundred,” said Vermeer.
“Three hundred and five,” Norman echoed.
“Five hundred,” said Vermeer without blinking an eye.
Realizing that the two men were bidding against each other the rest dropped out. The audience seemed to settle back in expectancy. Men had been known to pay the complete prize money of a venture for a girl.
“Five hundred and five,” Norman said in a determined voice.
“Really,” said Vermeer; “you’re wasting your time. I intend to have that girl. From one venture you can’t possibly have

enough money to outbid me. One thousand notes,” he addressed the auctioneer.
“A thousand notes, I’m offered,” chanted the auctioneer.
“A thousand notes. Do I hear more?”
Norman bit his lip. It was only too true that Vermeer could outbid him. With a sudden grim determination he balled his fist, walloped Vermeer in the temple. All his indignation was behind that blow, all the bone and gristle of six-foot-two of lecturer on Ancient History. Vermeer went down and out like a pole axed steer.
“One thousand and one,” shouted Norman triumphantly.
For a moment a hush gripped the audience, then the men roared with laughter. No one liked the Venusian Export Lines men, the pet of the Dohlmites.
“Going,” chanted the auctioneer, “going. Gone! To the impetuous gentleman with the good right fist!”
For the life of him, Norman couldn’t help swaggering a little as he went up to claim the girl.
The auctioneer tossed Jennifer her cape. She snatched it closely about herself, leaped down from the platform.
Norman counted out the bills. Jennifer, without glancing at her purchaser, walked swiftly ahead of him through the throng.
The sixth slave to be led to the auction block was Jennifer.
A pirate reached out, clapped him on
the shoulder. “She’s worth it/’ he chortled. “She’s worth it.” But Norman was being beset by doubts. He hadn’t liked the steely glint in the girl’s blue eyes. It foreboded trouble. Koal joined them chuckling, as they lift the market place.
Once outside Jennifer stopped, swung on Norman. “All right,” she said in a suppressed voice. “You’ve bought me. But you’ll regret it as long as you live, you, you—renegade!”
Her tone brought him up short. “Of all the ungrateful wenches,” he flared; “you are the prize. I joined the Dohl-mites with the express purpose of rescuing you. I plank down one thousand notes cash to save you from what in the old days was considered a fate worse than death.”
The girl’s features registered surprise, incredulity, contrition. She started to say, “I didn’t know,” but Norman was thoroughly wound up.
“Of course, I realize that view is no longer entertained by the best informed people, but if you are so anxious for Vermeer to buy you, I’ll go throw a bucket of water in his face and present you to him with my compliments.”
Indignation swept away all other emotions from the girl’s features. “I think you’re horrible,” she said and turned her back on him.
Koal suddenly shouted, “Look out, Norman!”
The young man swung around, saw Vermeer boring down on him. The agent had a poisoned needle gun in his hand. His temple wras swollen, his eyes furious. Scarcely three steps away he swung the needle gun up.
Norman heard the weapon plop softly. At the same instant something swished between him and the murderous dart gun. Jennifer, he realized, had pulled the cloak from her bare shoulders, flung it between them.
He snatched the cloak, flipped it over Vermeer’s head and shoulders. His rush bowled the man over backwards. The dart gun dropped to the pavement. Norman snatched it up just as Vermeer flung the cloak off his head, sprang to his feet.
“Kill him!” shouted Koal. “Quick!”
Vermeer’s face blanched. He turned, began to run back toward the slave
market, bent over, zig-zagging wildly.
Norman brought the dart gun up, then let it fall helplessly at his side.
“I can’t do it,” he said.
He picked up the cloak, started to return it to Jennifer. His eye lit on a slender, three-cornered needle stuck halfway through the heavy material. He pulled the poisoned dart out. One scratch from that deadly missile would have killed him. The girl’s instinctive action had saved his life. He felt weak.
“I’m sorry for what I said, Jennifer.” “For heaven’s sake,” she cried; “apologize later, if you must, but give me back my cloak now.”
VII
ONCE back in his apartment, Norman flung himself down in a chair. They had stopped on the way home in an establishment which sold the short tunics proscribed by law for all female slaves and Norman purchased the girl a complete outfit. She had chosen one of the smaller bedrooms and was putting her things away now. Koal was lounging on the couch.
“Koal,” began Norman, “I’ve an idea and I’d like your opinion.”
“Go ahead,” replied the Martian with a chuckle. “You really want me to agree with you. But if it has to do with escaping, I warn you, I shall be disagreeable.”
Norman grinned, said, “Koal, twentieth century Eire was under the British crown, but for a long time an underground army had fought the English Black and Tans. Around Nineteen-twenty they threw off the English yoke. That party of liberation was known as the Sinn Feiners.” Jennifer wandered back in the room in time to hear the last of Norman’s words. She sat down, listened.
“S'o?” said Koal.
“So,” said Norman. “I think that if a little group of patriots like the Sinn Feiners could throw off the yoke of the British Empire, we should be able to turn the tables on the Dohlmites.”
“I’ve seen rebellions before,” began Koal stonily.
“I know. But Koal, I’m not proposing any premature mutiny. I do believe,
though, we should band together secretly. If any opportunity for escape presents itself, we’ll be ready for it; not just a disunited group of clans snapping at each other’s throats.”
• The Martian appeared to waver.
“Koal,” Norman went on urgently. “Only one thing stands between us and freedom. The death broadcasting ma-• chine.”
“Yes, just that—and a force wall impossible to penetrate.”
“What maintains the force wall?” asked Norman.
The Martian shook his head.
“Suppose we succeed in neutralizing it. We’d have a picked body of men to rush the Dohlmite station, destroy the cylinders.”
Koal scratched his head speculatively. He said, “The men would have to be carefully chosen. It would be suicide should any word of the society leak to the Dohlmites.” He rose, frowned. “Wait a moment,” he said and hurried from the apartment.
“Norman,” breathed Jennifer. “Do you think there’s any chance?”
“I don’t know,” he replied, a worried expression on his gaunt features; “but if I can persuade the men to unite there’s hope.” He ran his fingers through his crisp blond hair. “It’s more than that, too. We’ll be the only force standing between the Dohlmites and the Empire. Somehow we’ve got to destroy them before they destroy us.”
The door opened, readmitting Koal attended by a tall, lean, yellow Venusian. The blue star of the killer cast was tattooed on his forehead. A Fozoql! Norman was only vaguely familiar with the caste of mercenaries and assassins. They had the reputation of being loyal and ferocious and were in high demand by the constantly warring factions on Venus.
“Norman,” said Koal, “this is Acpsahe. He and his brother with their wives were migrating to Ganymede when they were captured. His brother was killed by the broadcast machine while trying to escape. His wife was sold in the slave market to a renegade Earthman. I think I can vouch for his silence. Explain what you just told me.”
Norman shook hands, launched into a
passionate appeal for union among the men. Acpsahme’s green eyes glowed.
“Good,” he said from time to time, “good. But there must not be too many, and those must be carefully chosen. The success of the enterprise depends on secrecy.”
Koal leaped to his feet, his broad pale brow furrowed. He strode back and forth across the thick carpet. “At nineteen-hundred,” he said, “I am going to give a party in my quarters. A small, select party. Only the men I know best will be invited. Gentlemen, we’ll bring the Sinn Fein Society back to life.”
When they had gone, Jennifer looked across at Norman mistily. “You know,” she said in a tender voice, “you really are rather wonderful.”
IT was an oddly assorted group who attended Koal’s party at nineteen-hundred. Of the thirteen men present, there were renegade Earthmen, outcasts of the Empire, mad dogs feared from Pluto to Mercury. Another had been a T.I.S. agent before his capture. Pepperell was the name which Koal gave when he introduced him to Norman. Pepperell was a blandfaced, heavy-set Earthman with a gullible smile and a chunk of ice for a heart. The fifth had been a corporation lawyer. His noble brow and prematurely gray hair give him the benignity of a saint, but a thief, it had been whispered about on Earth during his remarkable career, had better ethics and a hungry tiger couldn’t be half so rapacious. There were three Martians, urbane, pleasant-spoken, and a Venusian. The Venusian, an ex-dictator of a small state, had been fleeing from his irate people with the treasury, when he was captured. Norman, Koal, and Acpsahme made up the thirteen. Jennifer was the only woman present.
The men were gathered in animated groups, drinking, laughing.
“Gentlemen,” began Koal, “may I have your attention. What you hear tonight must be held in the strictest confidence. If any word of this meeting reaches the Dohlmites, our lives are forfeit.”
Pepperell, the T.I.S. agent, raised his eyebrows, said, “What do you propose to do? Release cut worms among the plant men ?”
If any word of this meeting readies the Dohlmites our lives are forfeit.”
Pepperell, the T.I.S. agent, raised his eyebrows, said, “What do you propose to do? Release cut worms among the plant men?”
Jennifer grinned. No one else laughed “Thanks,” said Pepperell to the girl. “I see we both have the same low sense of humor.”
“This is serious,” said Koal. “Norman, will you explain your plan to these gentlemen.”
For the third time Norman delivered his impassioned appeal for union. “I know,” he concluded, “that we haven’t any definite means of attack, but how much greater is our chance of discovering one if we work together.”
“But the danger of betrayal,” protested Pepperell. “The more recruits to this underground army we gain, the more chances we run of admitting a traitor. No silly oath will hold some man from running to the Dohlmites in hopes of currying favor.” “True,” agreed Acpsahme grimly. “But a committee of execution should be formed. A committee whose sole duty will be to track down and kill any informer. Gentlemen, this is no seminar fraternity. If I thought any of you were proposing to betray us, I’d shoot you down without a qualm.” The blue star tattooed on his forehead lent authority to his quiet words.
“What powers the Dohlmite’s force wall?” inquired Norman suddenly.
The men turned back to him, their eyes serious, intent.
“I’ve speculated about that,” admitted Pepperell. “But no human is allowed within to learn.”
“If it ever failed, and we were organized, we could rush the Dohlmites, capture the broadcast machine and destroy the cylinders.”
“You forget the paralysis ray,” observed one of the Martians quietly.
“There’s a shield against the ray,” Norman countered. “I saw one. Vermeer had one on when our ship was captured.” “A green suit,” smiled the Martian. “But they are issued only to agents of the Venusian Export Lines.”
“We can steal them.”
A hungry look had come into the men’s eyes as they recalled the past when they
had been free in the Universe. Pepperell smashed his fist down hard on the buffet. “I’m with you.”
“And I.” It was unanimous.
Jennifer squeezed Norman’s hand ecstatically.
“A toast,” proposed Koal, “to freedom.” The men lifted their glasses, drank. Then, with one accord, they shattered them on the floor in a very ancient custom, a custom which hadn’t been observed in centuries. Norman’s heart swelled at the significance of the gesture.
VIII
IMMEDIATELY after the next sleeping period, Norman Saint Clair had Koal drive him into the shopping district where he purchased one of the surface cars. It had been agreed at the previous meeting of the new-born Sinn Fein Society that members should be introduced at small, apparently harmless parties. A list of possible recruits had been drawn up and Koal, after directing him to the library, left to set the machinery running.
The library was a large, well lit building with an imposing entrance hall. Norman searched the foyer, but could see no one. Apparently the library was deserted. He crossed the floor, peered. over the counter.
There was a couch behind the counter and stretched at full length on the couch was a girl sound asleep. For a moment Norman continued to gaze at her in astonishment. Her blond hair spread out on the pillow like yellow gauze. She had on a rumpled green tunic, and her naked ankle bore the metal slave band. He coughed discreetly.
The girl sat up, stifled a yawn. “Hello,” she said, regarding Norman with surprised interest. Her eyes were large and gray with black lashes.
“Excuse me, miss,” he said doubtfully, “but are you the librarian?”
“My God,” exclaimed the girl, “don’t tell me you want a book!”
“Why, yes,” he replied, uncertainty in his voice. “Isn’t this the library?”
“It’s the library, yes. But I’ve been in this vault for a month now, and you’re the first person who’s asked for a book. I’d rather be back at the factory.”
. “You used to work in a factory?”
The girl nodded. “Where they make the paralysis ray insulators.”
“The green suits?” he ejaculated.
“Yes. They’re green. Why?”
“No reason,” he replied cautiously. “Do you have any volumes on botany, horticulture, plant growth, anything at all related to that subject?”
Her gray eyes opened wide. “How long have you been here?”
“Not very long.”
“I thought not. Don’t you know those subjects are on the index? They’re forbidden. The Dohlmites destroy any such book no sooner than they get their hands on it. They even destroy anyone who has made a study of it.”
He shook his head.
“I’m sorry,” she replied, “but there isn’t a paragraph on plant life in the library.” Her gray eyes brightened. “What about me? You could take me out . I’m a hell of a sight more fun than those musty books.”
He said with a grin, “Do you know anything about plant life?”
“No. But I could show you a thing or two about animal life.”
He was tempted. She had worked in the factory where the green insulation suits were made. She might be able to give the Sinn Feiners valuable information.
“What time do you get off?”
“Now! Where are you going to take me?”
“But the library,” he expostulated. “Bother the library,” she laughed. “No one’s used it yet.” She jumped to a sitting position on the counter, swung her legs across, slid off on his side.
“There. The library’s closed for the day.”
“What did you do before your capture ?”
“I was on the triangle.”
He frowned in perplexity. “On the triangle? It sounds uncomfortable.”
“Sure. The triangle. Mars, Venus, Earth. Ninety gorgeous gals.” She clasped her hands behind her head, rolled her hips.
“Oh,” he said, comprehending at last. “You were on the stage.”
“The stage?” she laughed. “It does sound more dignified that way. I was in the chorus. Man, what I wouldn’t give for a glimpse of the Gay White Way or the Street of Sighs.”
Impulsively, Norman decided to trust her. He said, “We’re going to steal a green suit.”
“A green suit?” She raised her eyebrows. “What do you want with a green suit? You look much nicer in the outfit you have on.”
“A paralysis ray insulating suit,” he explained.
“What!” She clapped her hands to her mouth.
“You said you’d worked in the factory. Do you know where they’re stored ?”
She bit her lip. “Yes, in the warehouse behind the plant. But why do you want one? Don’t you know escape’s impossible?”
“Improbable,” he corrected.
“I knew it. I knew it when you wanted to see the books on botany. Take me along. I won’t ask any questions. Take me along, please.”
“We’re not ready yet,” he replied.
“But you’ll take me?” Her gray eyes were pleading.
He nodded, said, “The green suit first, though.”
She drew in her breath, “All right, handsome, I’m your woman.”
AT the door to his car Norman paused, said, “I don’t even know your name.” “Call me the Duchess,” she laughed. “I’m Saint Clair, Norman Saint Clair.” Norman got behind the wheel. The Duchess stimulated him. She was a little earthy perhaps, but clever. He wondered uncomfortably just how he would explain her to Jennifer, decided not to cross that bridge until he got there.
At the Duchess’s direction, he parked the car in an alley behind the warehouse where the protective green suits were stored.
“This is it,” said the girl.
Norman got out, surveyed the massive stone structure. The windows were barred like a jail. On the roof he could make out the edges of shrubbery.
“It looks like there’s a roof garden up there,” he commented.
“There is,” replied the Duchess. “The quarters of the men who work for the
Venusian Export Lines are on the top floors of the warehouse/'
Norman frowned. “There doesn’t seem to be any way in here. What about the front?'’
“It's guarded night and day/’
“What’s that building?” He pointed to the structure adjacent to the warehouse. The two roofs were almost on a level.
“It’s a slave barracks. That’s where the women who work in the surrounding factories live.”
“Do you think that we could slip to the roof without attracting too much attention ?”
All about them they could hear the hum of machinery, the pulsing life of the factory district.
The Duchess shrugged her shoulders. “They work in shifts. The factories never close down. This is as good a time as any.”
He crossed to the slave barracks, tried the rear door. It was unlocked. Cautiously, he pulled it open. A long hall like a hotel corridor with a stair well at the far end stretched before him. The slave barracks were not equipped with lifts. The hall was empty.
“Come on,” he said, and slipped inside.
They reached the stairs, crept up to the second floor. Again the corridor was empty and they continued their ascent. At the fourth stage, however, Norman halted, his eyes on a level with the floor. Two women were gossiping not a dozen feet away.
“Go on,” hissed the Duchess desperately. “There’s someone coming up the steps behind us!”
Norman heard the clatter of footsteps below them. He hadn’t time to hesitate, but leaped up the steps three at a time.
“Eeeek!” a startled shriek escaped one of the women. “Wasn’t that a man, Cheryl ?”
“Yes! Yes, it was,” replied the one addressed as Cheryl, “with a girl chasing him like mad, the hussy!”
“What would a man be doing in here?”
“Now what do you think a man would be doing in the female slave barracks?”
The excited chatter of feminine tongues all wagging at once overtook the pair as they raced upward. Norman’s heart sank like a stone. The way was closed behind them. Unexpectedly, he popped out on the roof, paused to catch his breath.
“Go on!” panted the Duchess. “Go on, for heaven’s sake! The party on the stairs below us. I caught a glimpse of them. They were plant men!”
“Plant men!”
“Yes! Yes! They must have been inspecting the barracks. Hurry!”
Norman cast a glance at the exquisitely landscaped roof gardens atop the warehouse next door. The gap appeared wider than it had from the street. Furthermore, the top of the warehouse was much lower, a wall surrounding the garden having given it the appearance of being the same height as the slave barracks.
An ominous mutter like the sound of a disturbed hornet’s nest ascended the stair well. Norman cast caution to the wind, sprinted across the flat roof, launched himself into space.
He cleared the top of the wall by inches, glanced downward. A man lay sunning himself directly beneath. The man had on trunks. He lay on his back and his dark sun glasses gave him a goggle-eyed appearance. He started to yell and sit up.
NORMAN landed with both feet in the pit of the man’s stomach. There was an explosive ooof as Norman sprawled forward on the roof. Then the Duchess sailed over the wall, lit full on the sun-bather, tumbled head over heels, arms and legs flying.
Norman got to his hands and knees, surveyed their victim in consternation. The man was unconscious.
“I hope he’s not dead.”
“You better hope he is,” said the Duchess, sitting up.
He felt the man’s pulse. It throbbed feebly.
“What’ll we do with him?”
“Toss him over the edge,” suggested the girl.
“We can’t do that!” protested Norman in horror. “We’ll bring him along. Maybe we can find some place to lock him up.” Pie took hold of the man, heaved, grunted, got him over his shoulder. “There’s the elevator house, beyond that rock garden,” he panted, staggering toward it.
They reached the elevator. It was an automatic lift, he saw. The indicator showed that the cage was on the floor below them. He was about to press the button when the Duchess’s eyes widened.
The needle on the indicator was slowly revolving around the dial.
“Someone’s coming up,” gasped Norman. Feverishly, he heaved the unconscious man behind a bush. The Duchess dived around the comer of the elevator house as Norman plucked a stone the size of his head from the rock garden, crouched behind a dwarf fir beside the doors.
The doors slid back. A man in civilian clothes stepped onto the roof.
“Bauer,” he called. “Hey, Bauer.”
Norman hit him over the head with the stone. The man crumpled.
The Duchess peered around the edge of the elevator house, stepped out. “You’re getting quite a collection.”
Norman looked worried. He hauled the sun-bather from behind the bush and stacked both of them inside the elevator. “Come on.”
The Duchess shrugged her shoulders, stepped into the elevator.
“Where are the suits?” he asked.
“Basement.”
He pressed the button. The car shot downward.
“Did you kill this one?” asked the Duchess hopefully.
He shook his head. “I don’t think so.”
The car stopped suddenly, the doors slid back. Norman stared out at a dimly-lit, low-ceilinged room which stretched off into shadows on either hand. It was full of bales, boxes and dust.
He dragged the bodies out, stretched them side by side on the floor.
“Where are the suits?”
“Any of those cases.”
Feverishly, he broke one open, pulled out the familiar green suit with helmet, gloves, and boots attached.
“Now that you’ve got it,” said the Duchess, “have you figured how you’re going to get out with it? We’ve got as much chance of returning the way we came as of burrowing through the walls. That slave barracks won't quiet down for a week.”
Fie appeared crestfallen, then his eyes lit on his latest victim. He brightened. “Aren’t the only men in Behrl who wear civilian clothes agents of the Venusian Export Lines, and didn’t you say they had their headquarters upstairs?”
The Duchess nodded.
He began to strip the clothes from their second victim.
“We’ll walk out the front door,” he said grimly.
“You’re a resourceful rogue,” the Duchess admitted with admiration.
In a matter of minutes, he had changed clothes. Hastily, he bundled up the green suit, wrapped it in a piece of packing paper. “Let’s get out of here.”
“What about these?” The Duchess indicated the bodies on the floor.
“Leave them there. They don’t know what hit them.”
They re-entered the lift, got off on the street floor. Six guards were loafing in the foyer. One of them winked when he saw the slave girl demurely following the young man out of the elevator.
Norman swallowed, walked out into the blessed sunlight. No one tried to stop him.
He didn’t draw an easy breath until they were back in his car, the insulation suit tucked unchr the seat.
“Well,” he said triumphantly as they sped from the alley onto a broad thoroughfare, ' that’s one.”
“One!” cried the Duchess. “You’re not going to try to get any more?”
“W'? need hundreds,” he assured her.
SHE stared at him in awe. “Hundreds!” Then she began to laugh. “Well, the Lord helps those who help themselves.” They drove along for a few minutes in silence.
“Listen,” said the Duchess suddenly. “You need more insulation suits. I know how they can be obtained.” *
“How?”
“I know the people who work in the factory. There are a few I can trust. If anyone could slip out the green suits, they could.”
Norman was jubilant. “Great,” he ejaculated.
“But you’ll have to buy me.”
“Buy you?” he echoed.
“Yes,” said the Duchess. “If I have to stay at that library another day, I’ll die. Besides, I need more freedom to contact the workers.”
She saw him wavering, put her hand over his on the wheel. “It gets so lonesome in that library.”
“All right,” he agreed.
The Duchess threw her arms about him. “You’re a dear,” she squealed.
Jennifer, he thought unhappily, wasn’t going to like this at all.
The transaction proved as simple as the Duchess had forecast. For the ridiculous sum of fifty notes plus the girl’s original purchase price, the agent transferred her to Norman Saint Clair. He turned the car into the basement of the apartment, his latest venture in livestock on the seat beside him. He had been rather silent since leaving the agent. Not only must he explain the Duchess to Jennifer, he had to explain Jennifer to the Duchess.
lie brought the car to a stop, said uneasily, “I forgot to tell you. I have . . .” He paused, started over again. “There is another girl in my apartment, too. She . . . Well . . . There are three bedrooms. I don’t think we’ll be too crowded. Do you?” He mopped his brow with his handkerchief.
The Duchess was regarding him, a steel-like glint in her gray eyes.
“Of all the deceitful, lecherous rogues it’s been my misfortune to meet,” she said, her tone low, gentle, “in a profession where rogues abound, you are the lowest.”
“Now I say . . .” he protested, but the Duchess swept his words aside.
“You wolf, bleating like a lamb. Oh, you’re clever. I haven’t a thing to reproach you with. You fixed it so it was I who asked you to buy me. But mark this, handsome, our association is going to be strictly business. You supply me with food and shelter; I supply the Sinn Feiners with green suits.”
“But isn’t that why I bought you?” he asked in perplexity.
“What?” said the Duchess, hauling herself up short.
“I mean, you didn’t like the library, and you needed more freedom any way to contact the factory workers. It looked to me like a sensible plan.”
“Well, I’ll be darned,” said the Duchess.
“What?” he asked.
“I apologize.” She held out her hand. He took it gratefully. “If you like,” she said, “you can give me a good swift kick.”
They went up in the lift. When they entered the apartment, they found Koal talking to Jennifer. He introduced the Duchess.
“I bought her from the Dohlmites,” he blurted out. “She’s to have the spare room.”
Koal regarded the Duchess with admiration, made a clucking sound. Norman reddened.
“What are you doing?” asked Jennifer sweetly. “Starting a harem?”
“Won’t it be cozy,” interposed the Duchess coolly, “twenty-nine or thirty of us scampering about the apartment.”
“What?” said Jennifer.
“Well, you know what the collecting instinct’s like.”
Norman hastily unwrapped the green suit, related their adventures. The Duchess, he explained, had promised to help procure more of them.
Although Jennifer still seemed skeptical, the Martian’s expression changed. He looked at the Duchess thoughtfully. “You can supply us with more of these?”
“Yes. There’s a girl who works in the factory. We played the triangle together. Her name’s ,Marcia. We were booked for a run on Ganymede when we were captured. If anyone can slip out the green suits, she can.”
The Martian nodded. “We’ll have a car waiting behind the factory.” He turned suddenly upon Norman. “I’ve got bad news,” he said.
Norman felt his heart sink.
“What is it?”
“The Dohlmites are preparing to attack
Ganymede.”
“Ganymede!” ejaculated Norman. “When ?”
The Martian gestured palm up with his hands, shrugged. “We haven’t been told yet. I imagine they’re waiting until all the ships are back. It’s the beginning of the end of the Empire, unless we can do something quick.”
IX
DURING the next ten sleeping periods an epidemic of small parties broke out in the human colony. The Sinn Fein Society from its tiny spark had spread into a conflagration. Apartment FI2 was rapidly being converted into an arsenal as the men hid rocket shells, ray rifles, dum-dums and dart guns in the basement. Furthermore, twelve bales of green in-
sulation suits had been added to the one Norman and the Duchess had stolen.
The Duchess had made good her promise and a steady stream of suits was being slipped into the hands of the Sinn Feiners. She was ensconced in the third bedroom of Norman’s apartment. Jennifer had not relented.
“When you add any more wenches to your collection,” Jennifer replied, coolly skeptical, “quarter them with the Duchess. I absolutely refuse to share my room with any of your paramours.”
Norman had returned from a meeting of the Sinn Feiners where he had learned that most of the ships were back already and were being refitted for the attack on Ganymede. Time pressed. He said: “Jennifer, I’m going to drive out into the country to try to get a line on the vegetation. I came back to the apartment to ask you to come along.”
“No,” she said perversely. “Why don’t you ask Alicia?”
“Alicia?”
“Yes, Alicia, the elevator operator. She’s been asking about you.”
Norman’s ire mounted. “Jennifer,” he said wrathfully, “I’ve been exceptionally lenient.”
“Lenient?” repeated the girl.
“That’s right, lenient.” He advanced on her threateningly. She backed of! in consternation. “It’s not uncommon for disobedient slaves to be given a sound thrashing, locked up on bread and water.” “You wouldn’t dare.” The girl compressed her lips.
“Now then,” he went on, “are you coming with me peacefully or must I descend to force?”
She stamped her foot. “No!”
Norman grabbed her, slung her over his shoulder, started for the door.
“Put me down! Put me down!” she cried, kicking vigorously.
“Are you coming along quietly?”
“No!”
He carried her into the hall, made for the elevator, pressed the button.
“Norman,” she pleaded in consternation. “Put me down before that elevator gets here.”
“Are you coming quietly?”
“Yes. For heaven’s sake, yes!”
He placed her on her feet. She brushed her black hair from her eyes, straightened
her white tunic with a wriggle.
“Oh!” she said, “of all the indignities!” But the corners of her lips kept trying to break into a grin. “Would you really have hauled me to your car like that in front of everybody?”
“Yes,” he replied seriously.
In spite of herself Jennifer burst into laughter. “You know, sometimes you’re the most amazing rogue I’ve ever met. I can’t stav angrv at you for ten minutes.”
■/	O W'	m/
The city of Behrl had been built around the enormous blow hole through which escaping gasses in some distant geological age had burst to the surface of Neptune. Beyond its outskirts lay a hilly country matted with undergrowth. The road kept getting worse and worse until finally it ended abruptly on the slope of a hill.
Norman brought the car to a stop. “End of the line,” he said and hopped out. Jennifer followed him.
“Well,” said Jennifer glancing at the weird vegetation about them. “Where do we start?”
“I don’t know,” he confessed. His eyes swept the country. A thick growth of small shrubs matted with creepers cloaked the hillside. The air smelled rich, hot, fertile.
“By Jove,” he exclaimed, “what's that?” He pointed to a bare spot a quarter of a mile away. It was several acres in extent. And even in the rosy sunlight it seemed to pulse with a phosphorescent light.
Jennifer shivered. “What makes the light ?”
“Let’s take a look at it,” he suggested.
NORMAN ill the lead, they began to
force their way through the grotesque, waist-high jungle. The sun beat down hotly on their uncovered heads. He wiped the perspiration from his face, swatted vindictively at a small persistent insect.
Jennifer tripped on a thick purple creeper, muttered something under her breath which sounded like cursing. Norman grinned, plowed ahead. It took them almost half an hour to reach the edge of the bare spot.
“A landslide,” he ejaculated.
The slide had gouged a deep gash in the loamy soil of the hillside. It was from this gash that the glow emanated. For yards on either side the vegetation was
dead. He crossed the belt of dead plants, approached the gash. On the brink, he paused, shaded his eyes, backed off hastily.
“Stay away!” he cautioned the girl.
“Don’t look in there!”
“Why?” she cried, halting in her
tracks.
“Radium! I’m not sure, but I think it’s almost pure radium. Jennifer, do you realize? The landslide has uncovered a fortune. We’re rich!”
She looked at him sadly. “What difference does it make?”.
But his jubilation was not to be dampened. “We won’t be here forever. Um-um!” He smacked his lips, almost danced. “Radium! We’d better get back a wavs, we’re too close to the stuff as it is.”
They retreated to the edge of the stricken vegetation. Even here the plants were sickly, wilted. Half a dozen of them were coated with red, rust-like scales.
Jennifer suddenly grabbed his shoulder, shook him. “Come out of your daze, Midas,” she laughed a little hysterically. “Look at the plants. They’re dead. Don’t you see. It’s killed them. Wouldn’t it kill the plant men, too.”
But Norman shook his head. “They know as much if not more about radium than we do. It’s dangerous, yes, but it’s not a weapon.” Suddenly he dropped to his knees beside a dwarf shrub. It was one of those covered with the red scales. “But, by Jupiter, this may be.”
“What is it?” said the girl in a stifled voice.
“Blight!”
“What?” she asked in astonishment.
“Blight!” he repeated. “Don’t you see? It’s blight. Look.” He pointed to the scabrous red scale attacking the shrub.
She shook her head in bewilderment.
“If the Dohlmites aren’t blight resistent, Jennifer, this may be the weapon.” His voice was hoarse with excitement, the radium forgotten. He said, “In the early days in America, blight attacked the chestnut trees. It wiped out every American chestnut from coast to coast.”
“What about the other trees?” she asked, puzzled.
“Well,” he admitted, “it didn’t harm them.”
“Maybe the plant men aren’t suscepti-
ble to this disease, either.”
“Maybe not, but it’s a chance. It’s the only chance that’s presented itself, and we haven’t much time left before the Dohlmites will order the attack on Ganymede.” Tenderly, he dug up the infected plant, wrapped its roots in his handkerchief.
“What in the world are you doing?”
“I’m going to infect a Dohlmite with this blight!” he replied grimly.
Jennifer giggled.
“What’s so funny?” he wanted to know.
“Blight! It does seem such an odd method of attack.”
Once back in the apartment, Jennifer dived beneath a cold shower. Norman, though, went straight to the kitchen where he transplanted the infected plant into a saucepan and took it out on the balcony.
He heard the front door open and close with a loud bang. He started guiltily, thought who could that be? Should the Dohlmites discover the infected plant that he was nurturing on his balcony, the penalty would be swift and final. He dashed into the hall.
Jennifer’s head stuck beyond her door revealing one bare wet shoulder. Her blue eyes were panicky. “Who is it?”
He shook his head, went into the living-room. With a sigh of relief, he recognized the Duchess.
“Norman, you’re back!” cried the Duchess wildly. “I didn’t know what I’d do if you weren’t here.”
The young man’s reassurance evaporated. The Duchess’s blond hair was disheveled. She was panting as if she’d been running.
“What’s wrong?”
“We’ve been betrayed!” said the Duchess in a frightened voice.
X
f f "DETRAYED!” echoed Norman.
13 The Duchess nodded. Her gray eyes were enormous. “I’ve been expecting to keel over on the street all the way home!”
“Who? How?”
“One of your precious Earth men. Hops, he’s called.” She paused, said, “I feel kind of dizzy! My God! You don’t suppose the Dohlmites are putting the finger on me, do you ?”
“No. No, of course not. It’s just shock. Sit down. Jennifer,” he called, “make the Duchess some tea, coffee, anything hot.”
“Tea, hell,” said the Duchess sinking on the couch. “Bring me a shot of whiskey.”
Jennifer had hastily slipped on her tunic. She brought a glass of whiskey from the kitchen. The Duchess drank it neat.
“Now, what happened?” pressed Norman.
“Marcia told me,” began the Duchess. “She’s the girl in the troop I told you about. The one who played the triangle with me and who’s been slipping us the green suits.”
“Yes, yes,” he interrupted impatiently.
She said, “Vermeer and Del Solar were inspecting the factory.”
“Vermeer,” ejaculated Norman. “I know Vermeer. But who’s Del Solar?”
. “Del Solar’s chief of the Venusian Export Lines. Vermeer’s his assistant. They are the only two humans allowed beyond the force wall. They’ve charge of the factory, you know, and it isn’t unusual for them to make an inspection, but Marcia was jittery. She was afraid they’d discover she’d been stealing the green suits.
“She hung around them trying to overhear what they were saying. She was listening when one of the guards approached Del Solar and told him there was a man outside to see him. ‘Send him in/ says Del Solar. So the guard brought this Hops inside. When Marcia saw it was a fighting man and not an agent or a slave she sneaked behind a packing case where she could hear every word they said.
“ ‘What do you want?’ Del Solar asked. Hops told him he knew about a conspiracy. He wanted to give Del Solar the names of the leaders in exchange for a post in the Venusian Export Lines. He told a lot more too: about us stealing the insulation suits, how the Sinn Feiners have spread all over Behrl. Enough to convince Del Solar that it was a serious matter.”
“But he hasn’t our names yet?” Norman clutched at a straw.
The Duchess shook her head. “Not yet. Del Solar wanted them. But Hops is no fool. He wouldn’t betray the names of the conspirators until he was guaranteed a post with the Export Company. No one
is accepted in the company without the plant men’s approval. That means Del Solar will have to see the Dohlmites first.”
Jennifer,” commanded Norman, “get Koal. Tell him to bring Acpsahme.”
The girl left, her blue eyes frightened.
“Go on,” urged Norman. He was trying to place Hops, then he remembered. Hops had been one of the renegade Earth men present at the first meeting.
“Well, Del Solar asked him his name and where he lived. That’s how Marcia knew who he was. He lives in G-seven, but she couldn’t remember his apartment number. Then Del Solar said he’d meet Hops in the Earth man’s apartment as soon as he’d seen the Dohlmites.”
Jennifer burst into the room leading Koal and Acpsahme.
“Wdiat’s this about a traitor?” cried the usually calm Martian.
“Tell them,” commanded Norman.
The Duchess repeated her story.
“If we can reach Hops in time,” Koal exploded, “we’re not lost yet!”
“Wliether we’re in time or not,” interposed Acpsahme in a flat voice, “we’ve business with Hops. Have you got your gun, Norman?”
The young man caught his breath. The meaning behind Acpsahme’s words was only too clear.
“Yes,” he faltered. Fie felt hollow inside. He wasn’t frightened, just sick.
“Come on,” said Acpsahme in that unemotional voice.
“Norman,” said Jennifer in a frightened tone.
“Don’t interfere,” he heard the Duchess say. “This is man’s work.” Then he was outside in the corridor.
While waiting for the elevator, they met Pepperell, the ex-T.I.S. agent. Koal explained briefly what had occurred.
“Spread the word, Pepperell. If we’re in time, this should discourage any ambition to sell us out among the others.”
THEY went down in the lift, entered Koal’s car, drove out into the blinding sunlight. We’re going to kill a man, Norman thought. Little beads of sweat stood out on his temples. He saw the informer stretched lifeless on the floor, his blank eyes staring at him accusingly.
“Don’t think about it,” advised Koal,
with that disconcerting ability to divine what was passing through Norman’s mind.
They turned into the base of G7. Koal brought the car to a stop. A guard advanced to examine their papers. Norman recognized him as a Sinn Feiner. Acpsahme leaned forward, explained their errand.
The guard compressed his lips angrily. “Go ahead,” he growled. “He’s on H deck, apartment Four-o-eight.”
They went up in the lift. On H deck they walked slowly along the hall until they came to room 408.
“Get your gun out,” said Koal, and
knocked.
There was a bitter taste in Norman’s mouth. He felt sick at his stomach as he had when he’d seen the murdered T.I.S. agent aboard the Jupiter.
The door opened.
Hops was framed in the entrance. He seemed to know instantly why the three grim-faced, silent men had come. His features went stiff with terror. He backed into the room. His mouth opened.
“All right,” said Koal.
“No!” cried Hops.
Acpsahme’s dart struck the informer in the neck.
“Search the room,” commanded Koal, stepping across the informer’s body.
They found a paper upon which Hops had been working. It contained the names of seventy-eight of the Sinn Feiners. Norman’s name headed the list.
“A real distinction,” observed the Martian dryly.
It was an honor that Norman didn’t covet. They found nothing else of importance.
“Leave him lie,” said Acpsahme. “I think we have been in time. The Dohlmites know there’s a rebellion afoot, but they don’t know who’s concerned.”
“This is one time,” observed the Martian, “when what they don’t know is going to hurt them.”
They started out. At the door, Acpsahme stopped, yanked out his dart gun. Norman peering over his shoulders, saw a Dohlmite accompanied by a man in civilian clothes. They were scarcely a dozen steps down the corridor. The plant man’s mask-like face gave no clue to what was passing through his mind. The Earth man, though, was plainly frightened.
“Del Solar,” the Martian hissed, his voice sibilant. “He’s come to get the names of the Sinn Feiners from Hops.”
Del Solar spun around, began to run back down the hall. Again it was Acpsahme’s dart which halted the man. Del Solar pitched forward on his face.
Koal fired three times at the plant man. Norman saw the darts strike the Dohlmites chest, stick out like pins, but he didn’t fall. The poisoned needles seemed to have no more effect on the plant man than they would have had on a tree. He, too, began to run.
“Quick,” cried Acpsahme. “Don’t let him escape.”
Norman leaped in pursuit, tackled the fleeing plant man about the hips. They went down in a tangle. He saw a knife flash. It was withdrawn green and sticky. The Dohlmite quit struggling. Norman staggered to his feet.
“Good work,” said Koal. He was wiping his blade on the plant man’s harness.
A thought struck Norman. His stomach revolted, but he forced himself to say, “I want the corpse of the Dohlmite.”
“Why?” ejaculated the Martian.
Briefly, he revealed his discovery of the blight-sickened plant. “I want to infect this Dohlmite with the blight. There’s a chance that when his fellows carry him into their city, the blight will spread.”
“It’s a gamble,” said Koal thoughtfully. “But it’s worth it.”
“Leave Del Solar lie where he is then,” put in Acpsahme. “We’ll take the Dohlmite.”
They dragged the corpse of the plant man to the elevator, dropped swiftly to the basement. Acpsahme called the guard.
“We’ve had to kill a plant man,” he said quietly.
A look of terror passed across the guard’s features. Involuntarily, he took a backward step.
“We’re taking the body,” Acpsahme went on in a low voice. “Hops and an agent of the Venusian Export Lines are still above. Dispose of them as you think best.”
The guard nodded. They loaded the stringy frame of the plant man into their car, shot out into the rosy sunlight.
Norman felt dazed. Although he had not actually killed any of the three, he considered himself as guilty as if it had
been his finger that pulled the trigger. He began to tremble. He felt as if he were going to be violently sick.
“Brace up,” said Koal with that queer intuition. “It’ll pass.”
Acpsahme chuckled. “The first man I killed, I ran to my house and cried like a baby. I couldn’t stop. I wanted them to bleach the tattoo off my forehead.” Somehow Norman felt better.
WHEN they reached the basement of FI2, they left Acpsahme to guard the body, ascended in the lift to Norman’s apartment.
Jennifer and the Duchess met them at the door. Jennifer had been crying, Norman saw with satisfaction.
“Norman, Norman,” the girl said and flew to his arms.
He patted her shoulder, disengaged himself gently. “We’ve still got work to do.” “We had to kill Del Solar and a plant man,” Koal explained briefly. “The Dohlmites are going to be furious, but I don’t think they will suspect us. Norman has an experiment he wants to try with the body of the Dohlmite.”
The Duchess turned to him, astonished. “The blight,” he explained. “I’m going to try to infect the plant man with the blight. When the Dohlmites find his body and carry it into their city, I’m gambling on it spreading.”
He retrieved the infected plant from the balcony. Even in that short time the shrub had visibly wilted. The blight had spread over twice its former area.
“It seems to be a virulent disease,” observed the Martian.
They carried the infected plant to the basement. Norman dusted the corpse from head to foot with the rust-like scales. Anything touching the body would be bound to come in contact with them.
“All right,” said Acpsahme, “let’s take him out and get this over with.”
A broad yellow line marked the zone beyond which it was death to stray. It was the first time Norman had been close to the force wall. lie looked at it curiously.
A ribbon of some unfamiliar silver metal wound like the track of a mono rail around the base of the hill where the Dohlmites had their houses. There were no visible rays arising from the ribbon, no distortion of the atmosphere, nothing. It looked utterly harmless.
“I wonder what would happen if you broke the circuit,” speculated Norman.
Koal98 blade flashed, cut into the Dohlmitis neck•
“It’s impossible,” replied Koal. “The zone of force protects the ribbon. Look.” He threw a pebble toward the silver track of metal. While still a yard from the ribbon, the stone exploded like a hand grenade. It was as if the force radiating from the track had touched off the atoms of the pebble. Norman blinked his eyes involuntarily.
“How do the Dohlmites pass through?”
‘There’s a gate only a short distance from here where they can shut off a segment of the wall.”
The buildings of the human colony, Norman noticed, were set well back from the yellow warning line, leaving a broad road which paralleled the silver track. There was no one in sight. It seemed to be a very unpopular neighborhood.
“Get him out,” grunted Acpsahme. They tossed the body of the disease-infected Dohlmite to the road.
“The Trojan horse,” thought Norman, remembering a tale from the dawn of history. He glanced back once as they sped away.
XI
Preparations for the invasion of
Ganymede went forward during the next six sleeping periods. The Dohlmites had been unsuccessful in their investigation, and had withdrawn behind their force wall, transmitting their orders through the agents of the Venusian Export Lines.
Then the date of sailing was set. Norman received his orders to report aboard the Rocket within twenty-four hours.
He paced back and forth across the living-room of his apartment. Even if the blight did sweep the Dohlmites, he thought, with the Sinn Feiners away on Ganymede they wouldn’t be able to take advantage of their opportunity.
Jennifer entered from the bedroom, glanced at him worriedly, said, “Norman, relax or you’ll have a nervous breakdown.”
He flung himself on the couch. “If only we knew what’s happening behind the force wall. The Dohlmites are taking this so queerly. I haven’t seen one on the streets for days.”
The buzzer announced someone at the door. He leaped to his feet, answered it anxiously. Koal came inside. There was a flicker of triumph in the Martian’s eyes.
“The sailing,” he announced, “has been indefinitely postponed!”
Norman sank on the couch, only to spring up again.
“Something’s happened on the hill!” Koal nodded his head. “That’s what I think.”
“We’ve got to know what it is,” cried Norman. “If it’s the blight, and it leaves only one plant man alive, he’s still master of every one of us.” He paused, bit his lip, said, “Koal, issue the green suits to a select force. Have them ready to storm the hill. I’m going to reconnoitre the force wall.”
“Watch your step,” the Martian cautioned. “This may be a trap.” He turned on his heel, left the apartment.
“Norman,” said Jennifer looking utterly miserable, “do be careful.”
He kissed her, said, “I will,” and started for the door. A heady excitement was pounding in his blood.
From the apartment he drove to the gate in the force wall.
Two parallel lines of yellow intersected the silver track at right angles and indicated the segment which could be shut off. Just wdthin the wall he saw a small cage like a switchman’s shack on a railroad. But the plant man who operated the gate was not there.
He frowned, swrept the hill above with his eyes. Not a figure stirred on any of the airy balconies. Nothing moved in the streets. The city of the Dohlmites was a ghost town.
A feeling that he was being watched made his heart beat faster.
He caught his breath. For a moment he thought he had detected a faint movement in one of the doonvays. Was this a trap after all? Minutes slipped past but the movement was not repeated. The high noon sun beat down on the empty street.
He got out of the car, walked cautiously toward the force wrall, halted at the yellow stripe. It was maddening to be stopped by that intangible emanation from the silver track.
Fie started to turn away, paused, staring rigidly at the hill. A man was running blindly away down the curving road which led between the plant men’s houses. Even at that distance, Norman could detect something peculiar about the man’s flight.	He wrould run several hundred
yards, stumble, fall, drag himself to his feet and go on.
As he drew closer, Norman identified him as a plant man. He seemed to be making for the gate in the force wrall. He reached the glassite shack, staggered in-
side. Norman could see him fumble weakly with the switch. The Dohlmite was shutting down the current at the gate.
Still with that strange intentness, the plant man lurched out again, stumbled, fell. He tried to rise, fell back. No flicker of emotion betrayed the terrible fear which must be driving him onward. He pulled himself to his hands and knees, began to crawl through the gate. He reached the silver ribbon, keeping in the center of the yellow lines. His eyes stared straight ahead. He wobbled across the force wall, kept on. Crawling on hands and knees, he passed within ten feet of Norman and didn’t seem to see him.
Twenty yards beyond Norman his wobble became more pronounced, like a toy running down. Then he seemed to hesitate. His arms and legs suddenly gave way. He collapsed. This time he didn’t try to rise, but lay still, lay still as death. Norman shuddered and looked away.
From head to heels the plant man was covered with the red, rust-like scales.
WITH a start Norman realized that
the way into the city lay open before him. He drew his breath sharply, walked slowly between the parallel yellow lines. His nerves quivered as he stepped across the silver track. He was inside at last. He set out up the hill.
As Norman reached the first houses, the toll exacted by the scabrous red blight became apparent. It had swept the population on the hill like a plague. Plant men lay in the streets, on the balconies, in the houses, their bodies scaly with rust. It had even begun to spread to the festooned hanging gardens.
Crowning the apex of the hill was a tremendous structure pillared like the incredibly ancient Grecian temples of which a few pictures still survived. A feeling of elation seized him. This surely was the buildiffg which housed the death broadcasting machine. This was the end of his journey.
A voice behind him shouted, “Stop, Saint Clair!”
He spun around.
Vermeer was toiling up the hill behind him. The agent of the Venusian Export Lines had his dart gun drawn and levelled. He halted half a dozen steps from Norman.
3—Planet Stories—Winter
He said, “There’s always a reckoning,
Saint Clair.”
Wildly, Norman speculated on his chance should he hurl himself at Vermeer in the face of the poisoned needles. He knew there was none.
“You’ve had a remarkable run of luck,” Vermeer smiled. “But by the laws of chance, it was bound to turn.”
Norman didn’t reply. The explosion of a rocket shell suddenly rent the air, followed by the crackle of dum-dum fire. It ascended faintly unreal from the human colony below them.
“My men,” Vermeer explained, “are attacking yours. But it doesn’t matter who wins. The real contest is being decided up here between us two. It’s rather like ancient times, with which you’re so familiar, Saint Clair, when battles were decided between two champions. You see, I took the precaution to close the gate before I followed you.”
Norman could feel the drag of his own dart gun at his waist, considered throwing himself to one side, snatching for his gun. Vermeer, he realized bitterly, had only to pull his trigger.
“I wonder,” Vermeer went on, “if you realize the stakes we’re playing for? The man who remains alive within the force wall can control the solar system.” He laughed exultantly, drew a careful bead on Norman’s chest.
He’s going to fire, thought Norman. Even at that distance, he could see the knuckles of the agent’s hand whiten as they contracted about the pommel of the dart gun.
A fantastic hope crystallized in his mind. Conception and action was simultaneous.
“Now!” Norman breathed, and fell as if dead.
He fell just a fraction of a second before Vermeer pulled the trigger. He heard the poisoned dart whistle over his shoulder, then he hit the street with a jarring thud and lay still. He daren’t breathe, daren’t flicker an eyelash.
It would never occur to Vermeer that he could have missed at twenty short paces. The very deadliness of the darts precluded any necessity of administering a coup de grace. Norman could hear the shuffle of Vermeer’s approaching steps. Had the trick worked?
Vermeer’s foot nudged him in the ribs.
Like the recoil of a spring, Norman grabbed the agent’s ankles, threw his weight against Vermeer’s knees. The man toppled backward. Norman swarmed on top of him.
Vermeer had been suspicious. He still retained the dart gun in his hand. Norman seized his wrist. They struggled fiercely, silently in the empty streets, their only audience the plant men covered with blight, full of the indifference of death.
With a surge of exultation Norman felt Vermeer’s wrist weaken. He threw his weight on the weapon, bent it downward. His finger covered the trigger. He squeezed.
Vermeer shuttered and lay still.
Norman crouched backward off the dead agent to his feet. The sound of firing in the human colony was silent. Whatever the outcome of the battle had been, he realized, it was over.
WHAT was it Vermeer had said?
“The man who remains alive within the force wall can control the Solar System.He, Norman Saint Clair, who had set out from Earth to lecture on Ancient History in distant Ganymede, was as much master of the System at this moment as if the battle had already been fought.
He had no difficulty locating the death broadcasting machine. It was housed in a tremendous hall in the Dohlmite temple of science. It was a delicate affair of tubes and wires. The cylinders, he saw, were fed into it automatically so that it could broadcast its messages of death with machine gun rapidity.
He seized a chair, savagely smashed the machine into fragments. It was a weapon of enslavement. No good could come of it. At length, he paused. The cylinders and the force wall remained, but they could wait.
With a growing sense of triumph, he left the temple of science, retraced his steps down the hill between the silent houses.
While still half way to the gate, he made out hundreds of men crowded just beyond the force wall. As he drew closer he recognized Koal and Acpsahme in the front ranks. He went into the glassite shack, threw the switch that shut off the segment of the wall. He forced himself to walk across the silver track, say in a calm voice:
“The Dohlmites are dead, Koal. The
machine is destroyed. We’re free.”
A savage cheer rang up from the men. Runners left to inform the rest of the city. Koal seized his hand, nearly wrung it off.
Acpsahme said, “The men of the Venusian Export Lines attacked us. They bit off more than they could chew.”
“Pepperell? Where’s Pepperell?” asked Norman.
“Here,” replied the T.I.S. agent.
“Pepperell,” said Norman. “Get in touch with the Terrestial Intelligence Service over the radio at once. You know their code. Tell them to send an accredited ambassador of the Earth Congress in the Empire’s fastest space ship toward Neptune, but don’t reveal our location. We’ll contact the ship beyond the orbit of Jupiter. I want,” he said with a sudden laugh, “to arrange a surprise for the ambassador.”
XII
DURING the following days a bacchanalian orgy skept Behrl as former slaves and pirates went wild with freedom. It was the maddest spree in the history of the System. Only in the apartment of Norman Saint Clair did sanity hold forth.
There the nine remaining men of the original thirteen who had launched the Sinn Feiners, worked ceaselessly to bring order out of chaos. Hops, the traitor, was dead. Pepperell, in charge of a picked crew, had been despatched in the Rocket to fetch the ambassador of the Earth Congress. Two of the Martians had been killed in the battle with the men of the Venusian Export Lines.
Many of the pirates and slaves would desire to remain, Norman thought. Here was a new world, a rich world with unguessed resources waiting for exploitation. But for those who wished to return, transportation to Earth had to be arranged.
At the present, the nine original members of the Sinn Feiners had assumed control of Behrl, but a permanent form of government also must be drawn up. The vast housing facilities and factories thrown open to the colonists demanded cooperative ownership, a communal government. With a sigh, Norman turned over his radium mines to the new state.
The nine men were seated about a long table which had been installed in his living-room. He said with a wry grin, “Gentlemen, I’m absolutely the only man in history to turn down mastery of the Solar System and then toss away a fortune on top of it.”
The buzzer softly announced a visitor. Koal rose, admitted Pepperell, the ex-T.I.S. agent. The men crowded about him, firing questions. “Did he have the ambassador with him? Was there any trouble ?”
Peppered laughed, held up his hands.
“Give me a chance, gentlemen. Give me a chance. Yes, I’ve got the ambassador.”
“Did everything go as planned?” asked Norman anxiously.
Peppered nodded. “Yes. We contacted the Empire’s ship. They had no suspicion that we were anywhere about until we caught them in the paralysis ray. We boarded them successfully, took the ambassador off. He was a very surprised ambassador when he woke up aboard the Rocket—and a very thoughtful one.”
“How much does he know?”
“He hasn’t been told anything,” said Peppered.
The buzzer rang a second time.
“That must be him now.” Peppered went to the door.
The ambassador was in the corridor. He had been escorted to the apartment by a squad of men from the Rocket.
“Gentlemen,” Peppered introduced him, “may I present Mustapha Tiflis, Ambassador of the Empire.”
“Jupiter!” Norman breathed. The Earth Congress had sent their ablest member, the man who was slated to be the next Autocrat.
Norman seated him at the table. Mustapha Tiflis was an Earth man of Oriental origin. His hair and eyes were black, his nose strongly hooked. He appeared to be in his early fifties. His features bore an expression of guarded surprise. The surprise spread as Norman related briefly the origin of the terror and how they had finally destroyed the plant men. He said:
“Ambassador, we kidnapped you in the fashion we did for two reasons. First, until we have been granted citizenship, we prefer to keep our hiding place a secret.
Second, we wanted to impress you with the effectiveness of the invisible ship and the paralysis ray.”
“You succeeded,” said Mustapha Tiflis.
“Now in regard to our citizenship, we wish to be taken into the Empire, not as a colony, but as a sovereign state with a seat in the Earth Congress.”
Mustapha Tiflis frowned. “It’s quite without precedent,” he said. “As you know, all colonies are administered by a governor.”
“But we are in a position to bargain,” said Norman handing the ambassador the document which the nine had drawn up. “We have the secret of the invisible ships to offer the Empire, the paralysis ray and a -world.”
Mustapha Tiflis was an ambitious man and quick to recognize opportunity. In later years, he was to rise to a position of almost absolute dictatorship, and with the aid of the invisible ships and paralysis ray, bring Mars and Venus under the wings of the Empire. He read the document carefully, scrawled his signature at the bottom. “And now, gentlemen, if you would be so kind, just exactly where the hell am I ?”
As the last of the Executive Committee trooped outside, Norman turned back into the apartment, saw Jennifer watching him from the doorway.
“It’s finished,” he said. He looked faintly embarrassed. “We’ve come a long way together, haven’t we?”
The girl nodded, slipped into the room.
His embarrassment mounted. “I was hoping . . .” he began. “This is a good world now that the plant men are dead. We . . .”
“Yes?” said Jennifer.
He drew his breath. “Would you . .
“Yes,” said Jennifer and the next moment she was in his arms. “A good slave always obeys her master.”
Suddenly the door to the apartment was flung violently open. The Duchess charged into the room.
“Where’s that bag of mine?” she demanded excitedly. “There’s a ship sailing for Earth at seventeen-hundred.” She dashed for her room. “Broadway, here I come!”
Steel Giants Of Chaos
By JAMES R. ADAMS
Earth owed the Wronged Ones a world, and Gene Drummond alone could repay that debt. Only he knew that payment would save two races from extinction — and he was a helpless prisoner of the
ones he wanted to aid.
GENE DRUMMOND felt a tingle of
anticipation course through his being as he stepped through the open airlock of his small scout ship and for the first time in more than a year felt the soft soil of Mother Earth under his booted feet. He stood for a moment, hungrily drinking in the noise and clamor of New York Spaceport. Around and about him the shouts and curses of bustling, grease-soaked mechanics and husky stevedores acted as a balm to his taut nerves. To return to this, after fourteen grueling months of biological research on Venus, was little short of heaven itself. The fact that he had been forced, because of the fatally-poisoned atmosphere of the young world, to conduct his investigation in brief sallies from the stuffy confines of his ship served only to heighten this ecstatic conception of his return. The profoundness of the moment passing, he breathed deeply of the warm, sweet air and turned to face the fat little mechanic hurrying across the field.
Puffing noisily for breath, the man skidded to a halt and bent a toothy grin upon the wiry biologist-explorer. “Bin gone a spell, ain’tcha, Mr. Drummond ?” the fellow wheezed good-naturedly. “Have a nice trip?”
Gene winced at the mechanic’s naivete, then smiled in spite of himself. “You might call it that,” he said thoughtfully. “But / wouldn’t! Venus isn't exactly paradise, Fatboy; take it from me, I know. All the moons of Saturn couldn’t persuade me to go through another year of privation on that forsaken hunk of cosmic dust. It’s a beautiful world, yes, but one whiff of its poison air and you pretty damn quick lose interest in landscapes and natural wonders.”
“Just the same, I sure wouldn’t miss a chance to take it in,” Fatboy opined
dreamily. “ ’Tain’t every guy that gets to
plant his feet on a restricted planet. You’re pretty dang lucky, if you ask me.”
Gene shrugged wearily. “Maybe so. Every man is entitled to his own opinion, they tell me. Personally, I'll stick by the motto, ‘See Terra Firma first.’”
Gene’s tall form suddenly went slack and his eyelids drooped heavily. “Look, Fatboy, I’m practically asleep on my feet. My next stop is home, where I won’t lose any time in renewing an acquaintance with a real bed. Take care of the buggy, will you? Give it a complete overhauling and when you’re done with that, put her in storage and forget about her. Yours truly is taking a long vacation from strange worlds and stuffy rocket cabins.”
Fatboy nodded absently and turned to enter the ship. Snapping his fingers, as if suddenly remembering something, he wheeled about and called after Gene, who was striding off across the field: “Hey, Mr. Drummond! Wait up a minute and lemme tell you what's happened here while you was gone. It’ll make your hair stand straight up and do a jig!”
“Sorry, Fatboy,” Gene shouted back. “I’ll shoot the bull with you some other time. Right now I have important business with the Sandman!” The tired explorer hurried off before Fatboy could collar him and regale him with the latest thriller of the-multitude of endless, bloodcurdling yarns that constantly made the rounds of a spaceport. He needed sleep, and that was what he meant to get.
Pausing briefly at a mail-tube, he sent the thick envelope containing a complete report of his findings on Venus speeding on its way to Science Center, whereat the document would be given a thorough and analytical reading by the greatest minds of the system. That account would shat-
Gene cut the half-men down one after another, but still they came on
ter the hopes of many, even his own, but it was Gene’s duty to report conditions as they were, not as he wanted them to be. TIis job was done; Venus was the Center’s baby now.
leather than wait for a tube-train, he decided to walk the distance to his apartment, which was but two or three blocks lVoni the spaceport. As he plodded tiredly along, strange happenings gradually made themselves known to his dulled senses. Although he was about to drop, Gene stopped to watch with a tense interest the impromptu ball game taking place on the walk before him.
A pint-sized batter stepped up to the plate and prepared to knock himself a home-run. The gamins ranged in the outfield hooted and leered, trying to shake the nerve of the midget Babe Ruth, but the boy stood his ground. Gesturing threateningly with the light metal bat, he spat contemptuously at a fat cockroach scurrying frantically from the field of action and grimly faced his hecklers. “Play ball!” he bawled.
The pitcher took him at his word, and after executing the tedious rite of winding up, whipped the ball across the plate at no mean speed. The boy in the batter’s box brought his club down fast to connect solidly with the sphere in as pretty a swing as Gene ever hoped to witness, among sandlotters at least.
Gene expected to see the ball go whizzing off down the street, but the next instant his expectations were abruptly dashed, in a manner that left the biologist wide-eyed and stunned.
The flashing metal bat met the hard-thrown ball in a resounding impact, and instantly exploded into a thousand tiny fragments!
GENE watched incredulously as the gleaming particles rained to the wralk, preceded by a tattered ball that had lost almost all momentum. A flying piece of metal ripped across the back of his hand, tearing away an inch or so of skin, but he was oblivious to all but the scene before him.
The boy at the plate snorted disgustedly and glared down at the remains of his bat. “That’s the fourth bat in six days,” he said bitterly. “I’m quittin’ right now. That
woulda been a homer, sure’s there’s rings around Saturn, and then the bat has to go and fall apart on me. I got cheated. Nope, I just ain’t playin’ anymore.”
Gene wTatched the group of urchins disperse, then slowly moved aw^ay dowm the street, his thoughts centered on the strange occurence he had just witnessed.
That bat—it had been made of a very durable metal, metal that wrasn’t given to falling apart upon receiving a hard blow. What had caused it to suddenly lose its stability and disintegrate into a heap of shards and powder? Something had very definitely gone haywire here on Earth during his absence. As Gene wralked, he found further evidence to bear out this conclusion.
A rather fat individual came waddling along the walk, making a grand show of bearing his wreight writh dignity. His stately reserve turned suddenly to consternation as the large metal buckle of his belt burst violently into powder. The fellow gave an alarmed shout and fled clumsily through the door of an office building, clutching frantically at his trousers to keep them from completing his embarrassment.
Gene had now entirely forgotten his need for sleep. He had to know the answer to this perplexing circumstance. One place would know, if the answer had yet been found, and that was Science Center. He hurried toward the nearest tube-train terminal, intent on having the mystery made clear to his mind.
At the terminal he found a message waiting for him. It was from Elliott Mason, World President, directing Gene to appear before the dignitary at the earliest possible moment. Apparently the message had missed him at the spaceport and had been relayed to the tube terminals along his homeward route. That would indicate utmost urgency, so Gene lost no time in boarding a train destined for Government Center.
He found the Presidential Mansion in a turmoil. Garrulous diplomats were everywhere in evidence, and not a few scientists from Science Center hastened through the halls, bent on mysterious missions.
Gene was immediately admitted to the presence of the president. Mason sat behind his ornate desk, poring over a thick
sheaf of papers. Worry and anxiety creased his brow, but even so, he flashed a quick smile as he looked up at the biologist-explorer.
“It’s good to see you again, Drummond,” Mason began. “Much has happened here while you were on Venus. Perhaps you are not yet aware of it, but a world calamity has befallen us, and as yet we have made no headway whatsoever against it. But before I tell you of our plight, I would like to know of your findings on Venus.”
“I’m afraid it’s hopeless, sir,” Gene sighed. “As you know, we cannot colonize Venus, since our respiratory systems could not long stand up under its poisonous atmosphere.
“As for the native Venusians, they are already man’s equal, physically, having a rate of evolution considerably faster than ours. But mentally, they are not much more than equal to a chicken. For some strange reason, their mental development does not keep pace with that of their bodies. Consequently, it will be many years, possibly centuries, before the Venusians are capable of rational thought.
“Thus you can see there is no hope of interplanetary commerce with them. By the time they reach a point of sufficient intelligence to realize the desirability of trade between worlds, our depleted metal resources will be gone, and man will likely be on his way down the evolutionary scale. Science Center has my full report. If I have been hazy on any point, they will give you the complete facts.”
Mason sighed heavily and lowered his head a moment. “This new scourge with which we have become afflicted also concerns metal,” he spoke in a low tone. “To give you the entire facts would require a long and detailed explanation, for which there is not time.
“However, the gist of it is that all our metals, including raw ores, are slowly losing their molecular coherence. Sections of every continent have come under the influence of the deadly visitation. Already two of New York’s largest structures have collapsed when their girder frameworks suddenly turned to powder. Many lives have been lost; tube-train and all other modes of transportation have become extremely risky.
“The condition, which first appeared a month or so ago, is slowly spreading to finally encompass all Earth. Science Center has discovered the phenomenon is not a natural one, but is rather an inexplicable ray emanating from somewhere in space.
“Earth is in great danger, Drummond, and someone must volunteer to eliminate that danger. Knowing our system as you do, I believe you are the man best qualified to track down the ray to its source and destroy it, if at all possible.
“Accordingly, I have had prepared a brochure, embodying all the facts you will need. Science Center has devised a special tracer mechanism, which when directed upon the ray, will clearly reveal its path through the void, and which will be installed in your ship upon your acceptance of the task. I—”
Gene held up a respectful hand. “I believe I have heard enough, sir. You were going to say the decision is entirely mine and that refusal would not be held against me. No need. I accept!”
Mason stood up and extended a warm hand. “Your courage will not go unnoticed, boy. The thanks of all Earth will go with you into the void.”
II
GENE nodded sleepily as his ship, New Frontiers, drove forward through space. The outermost planets were now far behind in the all-surrounding blackness, and a vague doubt was beginning to worry his mind.
Suppose the malignant ray did not originate in this system? Science Center had naturally assumed that the radiation came from some uncharted asteroid or rogue world within the system. But if it didn’t, then what? Should he return to Earth and report failure? Gene dismissed the thought as soon as it entered his head.
Yet, as the great, staring orb that was Pluto slipped away behind him, the doubt grew stronger and made of itself a steady clamor that would not pass unheeded.
His ship still followed the swath of the ray; a never-ending, invisible beam that would seem to sprout from the very emptiness of space itself.
Mason had warned Gene that he might face untold danger at the ray’s source, but the explorer could not see how that danger
could come from any living thing. Here in the farthermost reaches of the system, far from the warmth of the sun, what strange organic creature could find sustenance ?
He stifled a yawn, fighting doggedly to keep his heavy lids from closing in slumber. Sleep was out of the question. He could take no chance of losing the unseen trail of that devilish radiation, so that meant he had to go it without the help of the automatic controls.
In spite of Gene’s efforts to remain awake, his brown-thatched head slowly lowered against his chest. Tortured eyes no longer registered the monotonous gray of the ship’s cabin as leaden lids closed over them. He was asleep.
Instants later, the insistent clang of a warning bell penetrated through his torpor, whipping away the blanket of sleep and bringing the drowsing biologist at once to alert wakefulness.
He reached out frantically, his fingers flying unerringly over the myriad controls, jabbing viciously at the studs regulating the batteries of rocket tubes.
Something was pulling, tugging, at the small ship, drawing it dozvn, held in a relentless clutch that grew stronger with each passing moment!
The ship surged with power; steel crossbeams groaned and screeched, threatening to buckle under the strain placed on them. And still it rushed downward!
He cursed wildly and punched hard at the stud controlling the forward tubes. The craft lurched drunkenly under this new force, then continued its downward flight, moving not quite so fast now.
For the first time since awakening, he glanced at the Visio-screen, and what he saw rooted him to the spot, eyes dilated with astonishment. The New Frontiers was hurtling down on a planet, dark and foreboding; a world where no world should be! It loomed in the screen like a great black eight-ball—and he was definitely behind it! Now he was entering an atmosphere, according to the instruments. He jiggled the dials, but the reading did not change. What wouldn’t the astronomers of Earth give to know about this!
What manner of world was this rushing up to meet him? He could not know. But his instruments told him that in a
very short while the first Earthian feet would walk upon this mystery planet. If he lived through the crash.
Wrestling mightily with the controls, he succeeded in bringing the craft out of its dive and leveled off in a long skim above the sphere’s surface, now close below.
He hunched tensely over the controls, a thin film of cold sweat standing out on his brow. Hardened though he was, he could not help but feel a quickening fear of the inexplicable world he was fast approaching-
A formidable up jutting of rock suddenly reared up directly in his path, completely blacking out the screen!
He held his breath as his finger flicked out and impaled the stud operating the forward tubes. Once more fire burst from the nose of the ship, roaring out to meet the unyielding wall of rock in a titanic impact.
The New Frontiers shuddered to a halt, hung a second in midair, then abruptly slid forward and down. This was it!
Gene threw his arms over his eyes as ship and mountain met violently, throwing him from his seat and smashing his helmet-protected head against the control panel. Overhead a crossbeam groaned * tormentedly and gave way under the stress, while outside an avalanche of stone, dislodged from the lofty heights, smashed against the thick hull in a steady rain—setting up such a din as only the forces of nature could.
Then all was still.
GENE climbed unsteadily to his feet
and felt tenderly of his throbbing head. It still rested atop his shoulders. A wonder he hadn’t been stretched out for the count. Except for minor bruises and cuts he was no worse for the experience.
A quick look about assured him that the damage to the interior of the ship was slight. The crumpled girder would not impair the craft’s flight.
Clambering outside, he found one of the stern tubes smashed beyond repair. No matter. He could replace it with one of the two spare tubes the New Frontiers carried.
Altogether, the small scouter was not much worse for its experience. It would take but a few hours to install the new
tube, and the battered but faithful ship would be ready to blast off to new adventures.
Gene turned curiously and took up a minute inspection of this tenth planet’s terrain. Bleak and forbidding, jumbled masses of black rock stretch away to the horizon. Here and there, patches of slat-ish soil, naked and sterile, contended with the ever-present stone for surface space. He became aware of an insidious chill gnawing at his bones.
Cautiously lifting the air helmet he had donned before emerging from the ship, he sniffed tentatively of the dry, thin air. It seemed to have no ill effects on him. He removed the helmet and stood irresolute, wondering what next to do.
That problem was solved at once. Over the horizon came a howling, clamorous horde of man-shaped creatures, brandishing crudely fashioned spears tipped with sharpened stone, making straightway for the Nezu Frontiers!
Gene’s hand went to his hip and came up bearing his energy-ray. Any question of the creatures’ intentions was immediately dispelled as one of them jerked to a halt and flung his spear hard at the explorer.
Gene ducked and came up blasting. A grim smile was on his lips as the rabble came on in spite of his withering fire, screeching like harpies as they closed in on him.
He found time to wonder how the beings could see, for no eyes were evident on the flat, hateful faces. Wicked fangs gleamed in the gaping mouths; set squarely between where the eyes should have been was a diminutive, almost non-existent nose. Huge, batlike ears gave the finishing touch to their grotesque appearance.
Gene felt a deep loathing for these weird denizens of a world that should not be. That abhorrence was reflected in the steady blast of his energy-ray, which cut a wide swath in the creatures’ ranks.
But still they advanced, shrieking and gnashing their teeth in black hate. They flung their spears with such clumsiness that Gene found them fairly easy to sidestep, but now crude stone knives were brought into play, knives that were deadly, in spite of their unwieldiness. Once the beings gained close enough to use those weapons, the biologist would meet with a quick end.
He fought silently, striving to work around the ship to the air lock, but the hideous half-men divined his purpose and swiftly moved to flank him, cutting otf all escape. Gene cursed explosively and battled all the fiercer.
Then he gaped in surprise as a spear whizzed past him and sank deep in the breast of his nearest attacker. A look of fear crossed the features of the ferocious barbarians, and as one they turned to face this new enemy.
Gene, too, turned to look at the small band of sturdy beings advancing nimbly over the rocky ground, filling the air with wrell-aimed spears even as they came.
His assailants made a show of standing firm under the onslaught, screeching defiantly and launching their spears haphazardly at the newcomers.
The ranks wavered and suddenly broke, then the horrible monstrosities were fleeing, chattering their hate as they went scrambling away over the boulders. Now and again one would pause and turn to hurl his spear at Gene in a last venomous attempt to do him in. Then all had disappeared in the far distance.
GENE breathed a sigh of relief and wiped sweat from his forehead in spite of the chill air. “What a reception!” He grinned wryly. ‘‘Saturn’s Rings! The tracer surely developed a bug and took me off course. These people are nothing more than savages. I can’t believe them capable of constructing an intricate ray and directing it on Earth. The whole thing is crazy, just plain, crazy!”
His rescuers hurried up, waving their spears and shouting in a strange tongue.
Gene could not understand the words, but he guessed at their meaning from the triumphal air in which they were spoken. A crude tongue, at best, but then these wild tribesmen needed no elaborate language to express their simple minds.
Now the tribesmen, clad in shaggy furs, clustered about him, feeling wonderingly of his clothes, muttering exclamations of surprise as they noted the five digits on each of his hands. Their own gnarled, hairy paws boasted but four fingers to each. A towering, rawboned fellow pushed his
way through the mob and stopped before Gene. The man—for men these people were, in spite of their crudity and animal traits—swept his eyes over the explorer in a cool glance of appraisal.
Gene did a bit of sizing-up of his own. The giant’s high forehead suggested intelligence of a sort; the clear gray eyes told of courage and loyalty. Plainly, the man was a leader among his people.
Abruptly, the fellow turned and uttered a command to the foremost tribesmen. Two stepped forward and took up positions to each side of Gene. They prodded him gently in the ribs and pointed to the horizon. He took this to be a signal to start moving, and he obliged with reluctance, for his overpowering need of sleep now threatened to drop him at each step.
How long they walked, the biologist did not know. His guides were practically dragging him by the time the party came into a city of caves, hewn in the jagged wall of a desolate valley. He was led to one of these caverns, mid the shouted questions of the quick-gathered townsfolk and the catcalls of unkempt children.
Blessed sleep rushed up to meet him as the two tribesmen deposited him on a pallet of dirty furs and withdrew from the chamber. The world could wait; the body must rest.
GENE learned much of this strange planet in the next few days. A wizened, white-bearded old man came daily to instruct him in the tribe’s language—a simple speech which Gene, a student of ancient tongues, found easy to master.
“Our life is harsh,” the talkative patriarch told the explorer between lessons. “Game is scarce and there is little vegetation. Once we grew crops, but now the soil is sterile and bears little, but for wild vegetables and fruits in those isolated places where the ground is yet fertile. This is a world of rock, my son. No creature of flesh and bone was meant to trod here.”
The man spoke truth. All about, the valley lay barren, the sandy soil smothered under by tons of rock. Gene thought it a marvel that the tribesmen were able to exist at all in such a place. They must have great courage to fight such a hopeless battle against the forces of nature.
On his fifth day in the cave city, Gene was summoned to the dwelling of Old One,
the tribal chief. There, too, was the grayeyed giant whom Gene had first met the day of his arrival.
Old One raised a withered hand to signify peace, and the biologist solemnly did likewise. The venerable man nodded approval and settled back on his fur-covered stone bench.
“It stuns my senses,” he murmured. “Kac, say again this youth was spawned of a beast that walks through air.”
“Truly, he was, Father,” the dark-haired man said gravely. “The Beast People were besetting him and bearing him under at the time our hunting party came upon the scene. The spineless creatures fled at mere sight of our warriors, though there was a far greater number of them than our small party could boast. The beast that walked through air still rests where it fell from the sky. I fear it is dead, for no longer does it give out its breath of fire.”
“Not dead, but sleeping,” Gene said, wisely refraining from burdening the simple minds of these people with scientific principles. He noticed that many tribes-people were silently drifting into the cavern, curious to see this strange being who was so like themselves, yet so different.
“Now, Old One,” he addressed the chief in a respectful tone, “I know so little of your world. I am as an old woman in a strange cave; lost. Tell me of the Beast People. How do they see—for they have no eyes—and how is it there is so much animosity between your races? Perhaps, if their sin is great enough, I will help you against them.”
Old One frowned and thoughtfully fingered his dingy gray beard. “Nothing can be done about the Beast People. Long ago, they came from a world beyond worlds. At the coming of our ancestors, the two races took up a constant war for possession of this cave city.
“The legend is that they, too, were spawned of a great beast that walked through air. Their air-beast, just as yours, fell from the sky with a great crash. But this sky-monster slept the sleep of no awakening, and for them there was no returning.
“In truth, they have no eyes, but my father once told me of the manner in which
they find their way about. When afoot, they send out squeals, imperceptible to our ears, which come back to them from the obstacles and pitfalls they would avoid and thus guide them to an open path.
“Never, since that far day in the past, have others of their kind come to plague this world. It is my belief that the Beast People’s sky-monster rebelled against them and carried them far away from their goal, wherever it may have been. For that, their brothers who searched—if search they did —could not find their spoor and perforce gave them up for lost.
“There is more to their history, but it is not for your ears. Methinks, it could well be that you are one of the Beast People; for surely those of the home world have changed in the many tens of years since these few of their kind were stranded here.,,
Old One paused to glance quizzically at Gene. His bewrinkled old forehead drew tightly together as he studied the wiry biologist.
“Whence come you?” he asked sharply. “If from the world beyond worlds, then truly you are a Beast Man. If from a world that is sister to this sphere of rock, then does my tribe welcome you and call you brother. May your tongue speak truth, man of the skies.,,
All in the cave were tense, silent— waiting for the man’s answer. Gene took a step nearer Old One’s bench, calm and confident. A world beyond worlds would imply a planet of another system; thus, being from a planet akin to this upon which he had been cast, he spoke without apprehension:
“I name myself Gene Drummond, and I come from Earth—the third world nearest the sun.”
He looked about, expecting the tribesmen to loose shouts of welcome; but the grim silence only became more forbidding and the people drew back, as if from a leper. Gene leaped forward.
“Old One!” he cried in the aged man’s face. “Explain to them that I am not of the Beast People. I am an Earthling; your brother!”
There was infinite sadness in Old One’s gaze. “Nay,” he said somberly, “you are not of the Beast People, and no more so are you our brother. By the gods, you are of a race a thousandfold more loathsome than the Beast People!”
Ill
GENE sat dejectedly at the mouth of his cave, dully staring out at the black sameness of the destitute valley. Two stalwart Wronged Ones, as Kac had termed his tribe, stood at the opening, watching the man with troubled eyes.
Thus had it been for the past week, since the day Old One had pronounced those dread words condemning Gene and all like him. True, he was allowed to roam the cave city and observe the ways of the tribe, but always the guards were with him.
What terrible deed could have been done by Earth’s people to so bring the scorn of an entire race upon them? He had mulled over this night alter night, but the answer was beyond his grasp. Those of the tribe had never again spoken of it after that one accusing moment in the case of their chief.
He smiled wryly. Faring forth from Earth to solve the mystery of the destructive ray, he had run squarely into another, far greater puzzle. And when he found the answer to one, then he would surely solve the other; for he now felt certain that the two were in some way connected.
The solution must come soon. He had spent much time reading the brochure given to him by President Mason, and in it Science Center had stated that the molecular patterns of metal could not long withstand the disrupting force. If surcease did not come shortly, there was no guessing what great catastrophe would befall Earth. Perhaps the entire sphere would disintegrate and fall away in space!
Another riddle he had come across was that of the ^always-guarded cavern in the center of the city, about which all life in the community revolved. It seemed as if the Wronged Ones lived only to gather each night in that chamber and—worship?
All that his guards would tell him about the place was that it was called the Cave of Talkers. Old One had warned him never to go near it, and the guards were careful to see that he heeded the admonition.
With such things troubling his mind, he retired into the cave and stretched out on the miserable pile of furs. Soon he made out the glow of a tiny campfire outside, about which the guards huddled in the gathering gloom.
Strange people were these. It was very seldom they smiled. The greater part of the time sadness was stamped deep in their features; sadness that spoke eloquently of a great tragedy that had come to them in the dim far past. Plague, perhaps?
Gene frowned and rolled over on his side. So many questions; so few answers. He yawned sleepily and closed his eyes. Action. That was what he wanted; action . . . Then his mind became as the darkness.
He did not fare forth into the city next morning, but remained in the cave, putting into action a plan that had come to him during the night. The guards were not in evidence at the cavern’s mouth, but he knew they were near at hand. The moment he came out, there they would be, intent on carrying out their sworn duty.
Crouched in a deep recess of the chamber, he played his energy-ray on the wall before him, shielding his eyes from the bright glare with a gloved hand.
He thanked his lucky stars that the simple-minded tribesmen had never thought to take the gun from him. With its aid he would at least be able to steal from the cave this night, all unknown to the guards, and make his way to the Cave of Talkers, there to learn what went on inside that mysterious chamber.
The ray bit ever deeper in the hard stone, gouging out a narrow tunnel through which Gene could worm his way into the adjoining cave—that of Mree-na, the patriarch, from whom Gene had learned the language of the Wronged Ones.
Mree-na would not be home. Being too old to hunt, he spent his days in going among the people to hear their woes and offer his counsel in inter-family disputes. Thus Gene worked without fear of detection.
The hours sped by, and still he labored —determined to win through by nightfall. If he had judged right, he would emerge in the far reaches of Mree-na’s abode, where the shadows were heavy and where the feeble old man never ventured.
The wall was not as thick as he had expected The call of the returning hunters
was in his ears as the last foot of matter gave before the hissing ray and crashed to the floor of Mree-na’s cave, mid a thunder of echoes.
Gene stuck his head through the opening, glanced about, then withdrew. The way was clear. When the tribe met tonight in the Cave of Talkers, Gene Drummond would be the uninvited guest.
Brushing the telltale dust from his clothes he walked casually from the cavern and started down the long, sloping trail leading to the valley below. His guards hurried up and one grasped him gently by the shoulder.
“There you cannot got,” he said firmly. “Old One knows all. You would go yonder where the sleeping sky-beast lies and flee this world, but Old One and his people would not have it so . . . ever,” he added significantly.
**pyAMN IT!” Gene exploded. “I’m
starving for a good meal. I’ve got plenty of canned food in my ship; give me a couple of warriors to carry it here and I’ll spread out a feast for your tribe that will make the slop you eat taste like— like slop!”
The two men did not cringe before his wrath, but stood their ground; their sad eyes growing even sadder. For a long moment there was silence; then the one who rested his hand on Gene’s shoulder spoke.
“Man of the third planet, you have come among a saddened people; a people to whom a great—nay, the greatest—injustice was done in the dim, yet vivid, past. My tongue is pledged to speak not of this, but know you it is not by our will we are here. Know you, also, this slop you cry out against should call to you as like calls to like, for long did you wallow in it!”
Gene said nothing, but turned and stumbled away. He realized now that these barbarians meant to keep him here for as long as he should live. They wanted him to know some of their misery, their sorrow ; to know the hopelessness they knew, and the futility of struggling with an environment that gave not before the onslaught of humanity. Why ?
He was feeling like the lowest heel in the world by the time night fell. But he soon snapped out of it when he heard the tramp of many feet outside as the tribes-people passed on their way to the Cave of Talkers.
Hell! He didn’t owe these savages anything, though they tried their best to give him that impression. Maybe their plaint of injustice done them was just an act to cover up some insidious activity going on in the great cave!
Shaking with excitement, he wriggled through his secret tunnel and dropped catlike to the floor of the adjacent cave. A quick look about assured him Mree-na had already left for the big doings. He hurried to the mouth of the chamber and stealthily peered outside.
A few yards away, the two guards squatted on boulders in front of the cave he had just vacated, talking in low voices about the night’s activities. They expressed disappointment at not being able to attend the nightly meetings, but Old One had cautioned them never to go so far from their post as to allow their charge a chance to escape.
Gene took a deep breath and darted out of the cavern, running silently over the rough ledge to the next chamber. He crouched in its maw and looked back at the guards. They sat unmoving, except to reach up now and then to adjust their fur robes in an effort to shut out the biting cold.
He moved away, satisfied they had not seen him.
As he neared the Cave of Talkers he became aware of a steady vibration of the rock underfoot. He had never before been this close to the worshipping place of the Wronged Ones, if worshipping place it was.
No guards were here; they, too, had gone inside to participate in the proceedings. Gene eased into the vast cavern, staying close to the wall so as not to be seen. A rumbling as of giant sobbing beat against his ears, accompanied by the droning undertone of a rhythmic chant.
He stood at the head of the broad stairs leading down to the cave proper; and from there he looked upon that which brought a gasp of stark incredulity to his lips.
Below, the Wronged Ones knelt on the floor of the cavern, heads bowed in veneration as they offered up the monotonous prayer. All were there: women, children, battle-scarred warriors, and aged folk who could but scarcely assume a kneeling position.
All this, he had more or less expected; for after all, these people were but superstitious savages who looked to their gods for guidance. But the thing that astounded him was the two colossal objects upon which the Wronged Ones bestowed their homage.
In the center of the ring of kneeling tribesmen stood twTin machines, throbbing with power and sending off a wTeird effulgence. From one, a long, tapering tube thrust up through the ceiling of the cavern, vibrating violently under some great stress. Gene pressed nearer the wall, unconsciously fearful of the tremendous energy surging through that giant machine.
The other object of worship vaguely resembled an outsized dynamo, though such as Gene had never before seen. In truth, the resemblance was so little as to be all but non-existent.
Great comets! How did such a mass of intricate machinery get here, in this underground vault, on a world where metal was not knowrn ? And what was its purpose ?
A narrow ledge ran around the chamber’s walls, and Gene moved along this to a spot where he could look down on the scene without risk of being seen.
Now and again the droning supplication halted, and during these pauses Old One arose and moved about the machines. In his hand he carried a small skin sack. This he tilted over certain parts of the whirring, pounding colossi, and from it poured a thin trickle of what could be nothing but oil.
This ceremony performed, Old One moved back, then once more the gathered throng took up the melancholy strain of the interrupted invocation. Above all, the machines hummed and sang with unbelievable power; deathless power. Yet, it seemed the prolonged roar faltered now and then; stopped for the barest fraction of an instant. At such times, the multitude groaned; then prayed all the more fervently.
GENE’S mind was in tumult. This world was so unlike Earth: it did not revolve on its axis, the false night of the valley was caused by dense clouds of dust or some other substance which, carried by
the wind, passed over in irregular periods; thus one day would be longer or shorter than another. He doubted that a thorough search of the sphere would turn up enough metal to be worth the hunting, yet here were two giant machines, idols of a primitive people who could not conceivably grasp the mechanics involved. What a world! A world of riddles, Gene thought absently.
Then, a wild shout stabbed through his thoughts and he jerked startledly, almost losing his foothold on the treacherous ledge. The urgent cry came again, nearer the cave now, and with it a frightful uproar that raised the short hairs on the nape of Gene’s neck. He could make out the yell now: “Out! Out! The Beast People come!”
The Wronged Ones heard also, and poured up the stairs with cries of wrath at thus having their ritual broken short, snatching up spears from the floor as they went.
Gene hung back until the last of them had passed outside, then he, too, flung himself through the cave mouth. His hand clutched the deadly energy-ray, finger ready on the trigger to unloose a barrage of hissing death on the repulsive creatures assailing the city. He did owe the Wronged Ones something for saving his life, even though they had not treated him as nicely as they might have.
Chaos met his eyes. Grouped together as they were, the Wronged Ones offered a perfect target for the spears of the Beast People. Screaming women and children floundered about, colliding with the warriors and making it difficult for them to cast their weapons with accuracy. A great sorrow clutched his heart as he saw old Mree-na go down, his hands tearing at a shaft imbedded deep in his chest. Of all on this world, the withered patriarch and Kac alone had been friendly toward Gene. The rest bore him no hate, no ill will; but their eyes never looked upon him but that they looked with accusation.
He pushed to the fore of the throng,
' brusquely shoving aside all in his path. A long line of Beast People stretched across the valley floor, moving forward rapidly and determinedly. Gene could see they were set on winning the city this time, no matter what the cost. They carried many firebrands, and some of these
they threw among the disorganized foe. Cries of agony rent the air as the blazing missiles ignited hair and fur garments. Now, even the staunch warriors dropped their weapons to beat at the tormenting flames. Utter defeat was hard upon them.
GENE felt a hand on his shoulder and turned to find Kac standing beside him, desperation in his eyes. The young giant paused to launch a spear at the oncoming horde, then ducked behind a boulder, dragging the biologist with him.
The chief’s son looked wonderingly for a moment at his strange companion, then spoke quickly: “I do not know how you managed to escape, Gene, but somehow I find myself glad to have you here in this hour of crisis. See, even now my people fall by the tens; it will be slaughter when the Beast People close with our warriors for hand-to-hand battles. Can not you, a man capable of bending a fiery sky-monster to your will, find a way to turn back this vermin that would bring annihilation to all in this city?”
Gene peeped over the rounded stone and snapped a shot at the nearest half-man. The thing fell, its head completely blown away. Kac gasped and backed away in fear, for although he had seen the Earthling use the gun when trapped near the ship, he still thought of it as some form of black magic.
“Small loss to those monstrosities,” Gene murmured. “There’s swarms of them.” Then in a louder voice, “I might think of something shortly. But first we must rally your men and get the women and children to safety. Then we can work on a method of counterattack.”
Old One joined them and Gene quickly gave the men their instructions. Leaders that they were, he was certain they would succeed in the task of bringing order to the panic-stricken community. He was to hold off the half-men until the two could draw up an effective defense.
The chief and his son hurried away to exhort the tribe and Gene took his post behind the large boulder. He noticed the hideous ones were not advancing so rapidly now. They were reluctant to face again the fearful death of fire that had done for so many of them the first time they had come upon the explorer.
Kac raced up flung himself down beside Gene, just as a spear whizzed overhead and clattered to the ground a few yards away.
“They are poor marksmen,1” he laughed mirthlessly. Then, with pride in his voice, “Gene, the warriors have already rallied, and of their own accord! They are ready to fight the invader/’
A look assured Drummond that the Wronged Ones had indeed come back fighting; they scorned the protection of the rocks, but stood straight and firm, casting their shafts with a trueness that took great toll of the disappointed Beast People, who had thought victory already in their grasp. The long line moved ever slower.
“Well, that was certainly taken care of in a hurry!” he said admiringly. “What about the women and children—are they safe?”
“Yes,” Kac nodded. “The aged men of the tribe even now aid Old One in herding the weak ones into the caves. Now we may fight unhindered. Now shall the vermin know the wrath of my people!”
GENE did not voice his fears, but he was afraid the rally had come too late. The attacking force had gained too far up the side of the valley, and with their greatly superior numbers they could soon squelch the opposition in a man-to-man fight. It was uncanny, the way the eyeless beings moved over and around the obstructions in their path, as if they knew the location of each from memory. Even so, they were about the clumsiest things he knew of.
The valley was brighter now, and looking up he could see a dim glow filtering through the heavy clouds. It had been a short night, and that was well for the tribe; for heretofore they had been forced to direct their weapons to the target by the light of torches dropped by fallen halfmen.
But even though the advantage of daylight was now with them, they were forced to give back before the doggedly advancing enemy. Soon they would be forced to seek refuge in the caves. And as the foul creatures came on there rose up an endless, terrifying scream of hate. The fall of the cave city was near at hand.
Gene had been thinking about the things he had witnessed in the Cave of Talkers, and now he turned excitedly to the man beside him, a desperate plan taking shape in his mind.
“Listen, Kac! Go now—and may your feet sprout wings—to the Cave of Talkers and bring from there the sack of liquid used in your ritual. We may yet save the city, my friend.”
Fear was in Kac’s eyes, but only a moment. Surely the gods would give up their sustenance to save their devout people. He hurried off, bending low and weaving.
While he waited, Gene poured a steady fired at the abhorrent foe. Still, not a gap showed in that long, undulating line. The moment one creature fell, another rushed in to take his place.
Kac returned shortly, carrying the big skin sack of oil.
“This is all we have,” he apologized. “The plants that produce this are scarce, and so we never have a very large supply.”
“We can only hope it will be enough,” Gene said grimly, taking the sack. “Here, give me your spear.”
Kac turned over the long shaft and the biologist quickly poured oil over it. Then he inserted the shaft of the slippery weapon in the leatherlike carrying strap of the sack. While doing this, a torch fell at his side in a burst of sparks and he snatched it up, smiling.
“Thanks, sucker! I’ll be returning the favor shortly! Now, Kac, here’s what you must do: Take the torch and when I give the signal, touch it to the oilsack. Then stand away in a hurry. That clear?”
Kac grinned in quick understanding of Gene’s plan and enthusiastically prepared for his part in it. He crouched low, smoking firebrand ready in his hand, while Gene climbed to his feet and hoisted the odd ensemble over his shoulder. Gauging distance, he adjusted the angle of the spear, then took a firm stance.
“Let ’er rip!”
Kac leaped up and thrust the torch against the saturated sack, then threw himself to the ground and rolled frantically away.
The bag blazed up instantly, and just as swift did Gene whip the spear up and forward. The roaring ball of fire left the shaft in a high arc, sailing straight toward the unsuspecting Beast People.
Down it came, bursting at the feet of the nearest half-men. Flaming oil spewed over everything within a wide radius. It ate away flesh and hair with a voracity that was dreadful to see. Living torches raced madly about in circles, screaming at the top of their voices—then to collapse in smouldering heaps, the evil life within them fled before the cleansing flame.
All along the line, creatures stopped dead in their tracks, an unreasoning fear striking deep in their hearts, if hearts they had. They could not see the cause of disaster, but they could hear its roar and the shrieks of their dying fellows. To them, it was as if a raging holocaust had leaped from the bowels of the earth to gulp them in. Then, as once before, the Beast People gave up to panic, and the solid ranks suddenly disintegrated. Pell-mell they fled, back into and across the valley, putting distance between themselves and the horror that supposedly pursued them.
A jubilant shout went up from the defenders of the city: “The accursed ones are beaten! The man from Earth has this day given us final victory! Hail the man from Earth—our brother !”
A great pride welled in Gene’s breast, but still his mind was troubled. Now he had won the friendship of the Wronged Ones, but were the Beast People truly vanquished? Pie thought not. Even with the enormous casualties they had sustained, they still far outnumbered Old One’s tribe. They were desperate; this was a bitterly cold, dying world, and outside this valley, without shelter, a person unhardened to the low temperature would soon perish. The horrible creatures were vigorous and rugged, but the cold was becoming more marked, year by year. Even they could not long bear such hardships. He had a hunch they had not gone far from the valley, and would soon launch another attack on the city,
IV
PART of Gene’s hunch proved correct.
The Beast Pople were camped just outside the valley, this being verified by scouts sent out from the city late that evening. It was logical to suppose that the suspected attack would also become reality in the near future. There was little sleep for him
that night. He lay with eyes open, thinking—but little did he solve.
Kac personally brought Gene’s breakfast to him the following morning. The sad face of the chief’s son was even sadder this day.
“Many of my people shall no longer know the hardships of life,” he told the explorer. “One hundred of them fell before the onslaught of the Beast People. And— sorrow floods my heart—women and children account for more than half of the dead.
“Gene, my friend, my tribe is grateful for your succor in its hour of peril. But for you, the caves would now be in the filthy hands of our most despised enemies. Yea, you have proved yourself a warrior, and we belatedly welcome you as a brother.”
Gene was already engrossed in the food, and an unintelligible grunt was the best he could do in the way of a reply. Kac sat on the floor, watching him with wonder— and more than a touch of pity. His brow was furrowred with thought, and suddenly he spoke:
“You are not like those, those others, Gene. The legends tell us they were cruel, merciless. But you are kind, just, and your mind knows no deceit. Spawn of the others you may well be, yet their inhuman traits dwell not in you.”
Gene looked up puzzedly. “Hey! What in Deimos’ Dungeons are you talking about? Who are these others, and what makes you think I’m in cahoots with them? Listen, Kac, I’m an Earthman—flesh and blood, bone and hair, every single atom. Before Man, there were no intelligent creatures on Earth; and as for Man himself doing you some great wrong, it could not possibly have happened. Your planet is unknown to my world; I myself discovered it only by the most unusual circumstances. You’ve got me dizzy with all this talk about supposed wrongs, so how about putting our cards on the table ?”
Kac rose, nodding gravely. “Thus was it foretold. Time has erased all memory of the evil deed of your race. But our remembrance of its is as a flame that grows not weaker, but stronger, with the years. Come now, Gene Drummond, and learn of your sin.”
Gene followed the tall barbarian from

the cavern, excited and more than a little apprehensive. As they walked, he noted that many warriors were on guard throughout the community. That was good. Looking up, he noticed for the first time that a naked, black mountain reared into the sky but a half-mile or so back from the valley wall wherein the caves were situated. That, too, was good. The Beast People would be forced to come at them from the fore.
The trail led to the Cave of Talkers. Down the broad steps, across the flat stone floor, they went wordless and in awe. The giant machines loomed before them, throbbing and pounding with such a clamor as to bring Gene’s hands to his ears.
He soon grew accustomed to the noise, however, and went on with Kac to a small niche carved in a wall of the chamber. A vault rested in the recess, and from it Kac took a long metal tube; from this, a musty skin scroll.
The towering tribesman turned and looked deep into Gene’s eyes. “Now,” he said, “now shall I read to you from this ancient record, written by those long dead for all Wronged Ones to study and learn therefrom of the terrible injustice done to their ancestors. It is not pleasant, Gene. Will you hear it?”
The biologist nodded, a tight feeling around his heart. What unhappy, haunting knowledge was about to come to his mind?
“It is short,” Kac murmured. “Those who wrote it knew so little of what actually happened. Too, the language in which it is written is all but lost to us. But it is my fancy that when you have hearkened to these few words, little space will remain in your mind for other thoughts.
“Go ahead, read it,” Gene said hoarsely. “I don’t run from the truth, even though it may cut to the quick.”
KAC began; reading swiftly, yet comprehensively : “Long were we, the Wronged Ones, happy on our beautiful world. Like a green jewel in space it was; a treasure lost from the bosom of the Mother Sun in some careless moment.
“True it is that we were of simple minds; even so, great things were destined for
4—Planet Stories—Winter
our race. As evolution worked its miracles the ignorance that was born with us dropped away, and in its place came a high order of intelligence.
“We built, tilled the soil, and forever sought new knowledge to enrich our hungry minds. Our civiliztion was rising, forging ahead. The fertile soil gave abundantly of its treasure; power for our machines came from the Mother Sun itself.
“Then, disaster fell upon our world. Through space, with a far greater speed than light, stabbed an insidious ray—stealing our minds, our egos. Our bodies remained, but the egos that controlled them were drained away and hurled through the void.
“Great was our consternation to find ourselves on an alien world, inhabiting alien bodies; and bitter were we when we realized the egos that had formerly possessed these organic vehicles were now dwelling in our bodies, on our own fair world. A planet of deadness was this upon which our intellects had been cast, but we were determined to live on and someday know vengeance.
“In a word: in one horrible second, and much against our will, we had traded worlds with a desperate, dying race—our sphere of abundance for theirs of desolation.
“The machine with which the usurpers had accomplished this was beyond our comprehension, though our scientists worked long and feverishly to solve its secret. Long after, we came to the conclusion the machine had been captured from the Beast People and one of their number forced to operate it.
“Truly, we found a dying half-man in this cavern. He had been poisoned, so we could not force him to operate the machine for us and take back the planet and organisms that were rightfully ours. Not until many years after did we succeed in capturing a number of the Beast People, only to find they had lost the knowledge of the ego-transposer’s working. They were devolving at a rapid pace, and soon we, too, began to know the ravages of degeneration, though it did not act with such speed on us—perhaps only for the reason that we were determined to stave it off and one day return to our much-mourned world.
“Here were we, a rising race, now doomed to extinction by a treacherous people too weak to face the destiny ordained for them. It is true these people were intelligent, after a fashion, but there is little knowledge to be had on this rock-world and when the limit is reached, the mind must retrogress.
“There will be mutations on our lost world, for our planet was possessed of a much larger population than this of the transgressors. Thus when the hellish ego-transposer effected the change, many on our world were left mindless, with only the instincts of the beast remaining. Inter-breeding will greatly reduce the intelligence of the entire population for a time —though they will without doubt arise once more to a new greatness, for the means are there for them.
“There can only be sorrow, despair, and untold misery for us. Before the gods, there can be no greater trespass than this,”
Kac’s voice trailed away.
Sick dread was on Gene’s face. “Kac,” he whispered, “What was the name of this world that was stolen from you?’’
“Ours wras the third world nearest the sun,” the tall warrior answered with true regret. “The planet you call Earth. . .
Gene’s torment of mind knew no bounds in the following hours. Kac had left him in the cavern, warning him not to destroy the Talkers or the tribe would surely slay him. The biologist had given his word and even if he had wished, he could not have violated it; for nothing short of an atomic-cannon could rend the metal of which the titanic machines were built.
He had an atomic-cannon mounted on his ship, New Frontiers, but what good was it? He could not get to it—the Beast People surrounded the valley and would nail him the moment he appeared over the rim.
A small platform extended from the ego-transposer, midway up, and to this he climbed via a ladder' depending from it. A bucket seat was anchored to the flooring. He dropped in it and began studying the instruments before him.
Outside of two silver-beaded screens, the fixtures were simple ones and quite easy to understand. Yet, his manipulations brought no results.
Long after night fell, he worked with
the machine, and when done, he left with the knowledge that he was its master. The troublemaker turned out to be a broken wire; simple, yet it had stumped the Wronged Ones. The plainest things are often the hardest to see.
The other machine defied solution. Kac had told him that it, too, had been captured from the Beast People, who avowed that it generated rays beneficial to vegetable and animal life.
Gene learned definitely, though, that it was the cause of Earth’s plight. The working of it was beyond him, but this much he knew. This, then, was the traitorous Beast People’s way of exacting vengeance—by deliberately misinforming their captors as to the machine’s purpose. Too, they had tampered with some vital part, making it impossible to shut off the power.
There was no guessing how long it had been sending that deadly ray through space, slowly disintegrating all metallic matter in its path. In a few years, maybe months, metal molecules would be drawn so far apart that every structure on Earth would collapse under its own weight.
He thought his brain would burst, so many troubles did it hold. To add to them, Kac brought word that the Beast People were massing for another attack. This would be the final battle, with no surcease till one or the other of the clashing forces fell in decisive defeat—-and Gene knew with dread that it could only be the Wrong Ones who would go down,
V
THE onslaught came the next day.
Hundreds of the Beast People poured into the valley—screaming, gibbering, eager to taste blood. They moved over the rocky surface like some evil blight cast up from the uttermost depths of Hell.
Gene’s oil trick would not work now, for there was no oil with which to carry it through. The plants from which it was obtained grew outside the valley, and no one had dared venture forth to pluck them. The tribe would not be in misery much longer.
The warriors had thrown up a stone barricade in front of the caves, and from behind this they looked out upon the fast-approaching horde. Not a man among
them looked with fear, but with contempt and detestation for the vermin that came
to crush them.
The invaders were within range now. Gene raised his energy-ray and tightened his finger around the trigger. Nothing happened. Its power was exhausted by the almost constant use to which he had put it since arriving here. He flung it aside and snatched up a spear.
The first wave of half-men loosed a hail of crude shafts, hurling them with all the venom that was in their black hearts. Some went to the mark, piercing the breasts of those too slow in ducking. Their aim was poor, but they had many spears and many men to throw them.
Gene tossed his own javelin and had the pleasure of seeing it bury itself in the neck of a squat creature, severing the jugular. Then the battle waxed furious.
The tribe fought desperately to stem the tide. Even Old One and the venerable warriors whose day of battle should be past added their bit to the cause. But nothing could turn those squealing, hate-maddened beings that charged.
Of a sudden, a hairy, hideous face poked above the barrier. The thing snarled and pulled itself over the rocks to land squarely on Gene.
Man and beast met in a fight for life. The slavering brute bore Gene down with crushing strength, wrapping an arm about his waist and pushing back on his chin, trying to snap his spine.
The agony was unbearable. Gene brought up a hand and clamped it on the back of the half-man’s head, digging his thumb in behind the ear.
An infinite moment passed, then his adversary straightened slowly, swaying on his feet. The biologist quickly wound his arms around its neck and went dragging it over the ground to a boulder. Once, twice, he bashed the filthy head against the stone. The lifeless body dropped.
Hand to hand battles were raging all about Gene, and though the Wronged Ones fought valiantly, the knowledge was in their eyes that they were lost.
In horror, he saw Old One threshing about on the ground, the fangs of a halfman fastened in his throat. Before Gene could move, an avenging form hurtled through the air and lit on the hell-creature.
A stone dagger came down, slashing, tearing, wielded by the hand of a grief-maddened Kac.
The explorer turned away, a choking lump rising in his throat. Then, in his sorrow, a daring plan came to him. Heart thumping against its prison of ribs, he raced away to the Cave of Talkers.
NO ONE was there. The women and children were all huddled in their homes and, of course, every man was outside defending the city. He clambered up to the platform and threw himself in the bucket seat, hoping against hope that this experiment would work.
The ego-transposer hummed with unholy sentience as he threw in a switch, and a soft glow appeared deep in the silver-beaded screens.
Slowly, the image of a tiny organism took form on one screen. Almost at the same moment an identical likeness swam into view on the other. Then began a parade of life-forms across the screens, each succeeding animal a bit higher on the evolutionary scale than its predecessor.
The sounds of battle grew nearer. He had to hurry now. . . . Ah! There! The flat, repulsive face of a half-man loomed before him. His finger stabbed at a stud, and the likeness was transfixed on the screen.
The procession continued on the other glowing surface until the physique of a Wronged One took shape in the depths and came to focus.
The two reproductions stared out at him with unwinking eyes. Deep in the bowels of the machine the basic mind make-up of the beings was being analyzed. An instant later the throbbing transposer would set up an en masse connection with the race egos, then . . .
A green light flashed on the panel and Gene brought his hand forward on the master switch. It was done!
Elated, he scrambled down from his perch and hurried outside. As he passed between the strangely inactive creatures at the entrance, a horrified voice croaked: “What terrible deed has been done?” Gene grabbed the foul thing by the shoulders. “Kac! Is it you?”
“No,” it whispered. “It is my mind, yes, but it is not my body.” His hands
went to his face. “Gene! I cannot see!”
f$T?A.SY!” Gene hissed. “You’ll cause
llj a panic.” He realized that although the Wronged Ones could, with effort, talk with the strange vocal cords, it would take them some time to master the high-pitched shrill.
“Listen, Kac,” he said. “Call out and tell your people to banish fear from their minds, or many will die by the spears of the crazed Beast People. Tell them to fall on the ground and not to rise until you so instruct them. Hurry now, there is no time to lose!”
Dazedly, Kac obeyed. Though his voice was cracked and unrecognizable, it boomed with authority. Suppressing their fright, the transposed Wronged Ones dropped to the ground and lay unmoving.
Then Gene crouched beside his fearful companion and looked upon the debacle. The transported Beast People were groping about uncertainly.
They were in the same boat as their hated enemies. Sight was a thing unknown to their brutish minds, thus the eyes they now possessed were utterly useless; and try as they would, they could not produce the inaudible squeal which gave them knowledge of their surroundings with the vocal cords of their new bodies.
Two of them collided, and immediately struck out with their stone knives. To each, the flesh they felt was the flesh of a Wronged One—a feared foe who must be destroyed. Both toppled, screaming defiance even in their final death throes.
The scene was repeated time and again, till the valley floor was but a mass of shrieking, struggling, mangled bodies.
The carnage all but over, Gene grabbed up a spear and went forth to mop up. Some of the transposed Wronged Ones had not dropped as Kac, now their chief, had commanded, but stood about with vacuous expressions on their faces. He suddenly realized that there were no guiding minds in these husks. The Beast People had outnumbered the tribe; consequently many of the monstrosities had been left mindless when the change took place.
Finishing his grisly task, he flung the spear from him in disgust and hurried back to the cave, shouting as he went: “Victory is ours, Kac! The Beast People
are defeated! Now your tribe can rejoice!” But there was no joy in Kac, he found. Now, there was a greater sadness on the new chief’s face than was there at any time previous. Strange people! What could be the grievance now?
Kac must have sensed the question in his mind. He gestured disdainfully at his squat, hairy body. “Look you, Gene. You have made our plight far worse. Now we cannot see to hunt or to harvest the puny crops that we wrest from this woebegone world. This had to be, that is to my knowing. But I fear the tribe will not understand. I can sense their rage even now, my brother.”
Gene whirled and stared sickly at the warriors rising from the ground. It was true. Wrath was on their features as they fumbled toward the cave, guided by the very sound of his breathing impinging against their sensitive ears.
The blood - spattered biologist was stunned. “Wait, my brothers!” he cried, throwing up his arms. “You have not been betrayed! Today, you have won a great victory over your enemies; on this same day you shall begin a new life—a life of plenty, of happiness.”
But his words were lost in the roar of a people aroused. Nearer they groped. Kac added his appeal, to no avail. They would have the blood of this false-tongued specimen of a race that revelled on a world that was not his own.
If only they would listen to his plan! But argument would only bring about his death—and the end of all hope for a once-mighty people. He turned despairingly to his one remaining friend.
“Hear this now, Kac,” he said urgently. “I am going into the cave to—to appeal to the all-powerful Talkers. It is your task to remain here and hold off your warriors as long as possible. In a few moments wondrous magic will be worked on you and all your people, but fear not. Know I am your friend, no matter what strange, new vista your eyes next look upon, and never would I do you harm. When next we meet, it will be in a paradise far more glorious than that for which you mourn. Will you do this your brother asks?” The great jaws parted and one resolute word came from them: “Yes!”
Gene took the gnarled, furry hand in a
warm grip, then turned and bounded down the steps. His hands seemed to be all thumbs as he climbed the ladder.
At least, he thought as he spun the dials to long range, the ego-transposer would undo some of its horrors before its evil existence came to an end.
The splendid, sun-tanned form of a tall youth coalesced on one screen and Gene froze it there with a flick of his finger.
A panorama of life hastened across the other screen, and he recoiled impulsively as the flat, stupid face of a half-man leaped at him from its depth. But he knew that intelligence reposed behind those fearsome features—intelligence that would build a world.
Now the transposer was analyzing the race-egos—and the Wronged Ones were swarming into the cave!
KAC had been unable to hold them.
They had merely side-stepped him and come on, silent now and grim. They would not harm their chief, but they would let nothing stand in the way of their vengeance.
Gene rushed to the platform's edge and brought his foot down on a shaggy hand. A stone dagger swished past his ear and shattered against the machine. Heart racing, he flung himself against the master switch and slammed it shut.
Silence, then a chorus of meaningless grunts drifted up to his ears. Below, the half-men milled about like cattle, feeling stupidly of their bodies. They could not understand; they felt wTonderingly of their heads where eyes should be, trying to lift the darkness.
The New Frontiers still rested wThere it had crashed—how long ago? Gene replaced the smashed tube and jockeyed the ship clear of the debris. The tubes roared with power and the landscape fell away.
As he sped toward the cave city, his thoughts went back to the events of a few short hours ago.
In his feeling for the Wronged Ones, he had followed the only course that offered itself. That was the transference of their egos to Venus, to the bodies of the human-like inhabitants of that planet. To those whom Man had wronged long in the dim past. Gene had given a new
life, atoned for Man's darkest deed.
At the same time, he had given new hope to Man himself; for now, trade between Earth and Venus would become a reality as soon as the Wronged Ones could orient themselves to the new surroundings —a year at the most. The clouds of Venus had long since lifted, and the tribe would * thrive in the wrarm sunshine that now bathed the planet. Under Kac’s able leadership they would aid in restoring Earth's depleted mineral wealth, and in turn Earth would help them in building a lasting civilization.
Now he was over the cave city, and he knew what he must do. On the Vizio-screen he could see tiny specks moving about in the valley. They were stumbling away from the caves, away from what they could not understand.
He dived on the city and depressed the firing stud of the atomic-cannon. A gigantic concussion rocked his ship as the valley wall exploded upward.
On the screen he could see the remains of the machines in the rubble below. So ended the ego-transpbser, a devil machine that could lift the spider-web of self from the very brain on which it was spun.
So, too, ended the destructive ray that a desperate people, ever greedy for new wealth, had unwittingly turned upon themselves on that day of infancy in the now-forgotten past.
Now to Venus, where the end of his strange adventure awaited. There had been many more Venusians than Wronged Ones. This surplus now belonged to the beasts—mindless, with only the instincts of the beast remaining. These mindless ones must be segregated to prevent interbreeding with the others.
As the New Frontiers flashed sunward, Gene caught one final glimpse of the transposed Venusians on his Vizio. Now a race without hope, wrere they. In undoing one great wrong, he had committed another. But this was a primitive, ignorant people to whom intelligence would never have come in time to aid Earth in the crisis that threatened.
He had played God to them, but they would never know, never realize ... or would they?

TO,” said the shadowy man who 1^1 sat high above the floor on the ^ chair of the time-machine, “you can’t do that.”
‘‘Can’t, eh?”
“No!”
“Sorry.”
For a second, Bryan was shaken with indecision. This is intolerable, he thought. ITl turn the doorknob. After all, he has no real jurisdiction over my actions. Nor has he, in spite of the stakes involved, any right to meddle in my life the way he has.
His rebel thoughts endured for only that second. His grip loosened on the doorknob, his gloved hand fell away. He actually took a few steps backward, as if he would negate that action which led toward disaster. Then he turned quickly, urged his undernourished body back up the threadbare hall, into his equally threadbare room. Off came his shapeless hat, and overcoat which was ripped at seams and pockets, and he sat down, brain numb, the sensations of his stomach forgotten in the greater hunger.
Where is she? Who is she?
He did not have the courage to meet the cold eyes of the man who sat in shadowy outline amongst nebulous, self-suspended machinery, although that being watched him with merciless inflexibility of purpose. He had only the courage to speak, while his eyes fixed dully on the gingerbreaded metal bed with its sagging mattress.
“The Alpha Group?”
“The Alpha Group,” the shadowy man spoke coldly, in agreement. “Punctus four. You would have met her/9 “I thought so. I felt it.”
“You felt nothing of the sort You have an exaggerated notion of the perceptive qualities of your psyche,” he retorted.
“I named the Alpha Group,” said Bryan wearily.
“Because for the first three or four years of our association, the Alpha Group will predominate. And because you have come to associate certain of my facial expressions and tonal qualities with the group. There was no telepathic pick-up from the girl. She is not aware that you exist. Nor will she ever be aware, as long as you choose to work in close collaboration with me—and as a humanitarian yourself, you will not refuse to collaborate.”
Bryan leaned back in the worn armchair, grinning twistedly, though his heart was lead in his breast. He held the long-lashed eyes of the god-like creature with a flickering sidewise glance. “Perhaps you will choose to stop collaborating with me.”
The nostrils of the being flared. “No. Never. We will continue—we must continue to work together until the Alpha, Delta, and Gamma groups are exhausted— or until—”
“Or until I commit suicide as you suggested.”
“Yes.”
Bryan lost his tensity, and his fear that he could not bear it, might disobey a command from this creature. Suddenly, he was amused. Bryan was chained to this creature, but no less than this creature was chained to him; chained to him for ten long years, or until he might take his own life.
Creature? Yes. For certainly any animal that is not homo sapiens is a creature. Even if he be homo superior, of the year Eight-hundred thousand A.D., and has invented a time-machine, and has but one powerful, compelling thought in mind —to save the human race.

and imagining, aspiring and succeeding, for a good many millions of years, man was about to be snuffed out. So the shadowy being—homo superior—had told Bryan on that day a week ago when he had appeared in this room. The human race, far in the future, would destroy itself unless—unless Bryan Barrett did not
do something that he had done; did not become something that he had become.
THE thoughts of the creature had impinged on his brain clearly after the first moments of fright. Bryan had listened, and believed.
“So I’m a diversifal,” he had muttered.

“Bryan Barrett, liberal, radical, diversifal.” “You are a diversifal. I can coin no other word to fit.”
“And she is a diversifal.”
“Yes.”
“And our child would be a mutant” “Yes.”
“I thought,” Bryan had said, his thoughts sinking heavily into a morass of intangibles, “I thought, if one wants to follow the theory to its logical conclusion, that there are an infinite number of probable worlds.”
“Are there?” The depthless eyes of the being, looked down at Bryan from his shadowy height above the floor, had been contemptuous with disinterest. “I know of only two. They are the only two with which I am concerned. A thousand years in my future they warred—and humanity destroyed itself. This I know. This I must prevent. From your unborn mutant child my race stems.”
“Your race?” Bryan had exclaimed. “Yes.”
“You are seeking to prevent your own world of probability?”
“Yes.” The long-lashed eyes flickered. The being leaned forward a little, staring down at Bryan. “Why not, Bryan Barrett? Does it matter? It is my world of probability which discovered the manner of traveling to the other world. It is my world which waged the war. It is my world, your world, which is—will be —at fault. I am selfless. You know what it is to be selfless. You can understand. And, after all, you are the diversifal—the splitting factor.”
Bryan was inwardly shaken. The selfless superman. Or, and this was more likely, the selfless scientist. The picture, in its entirety, had come quite clearly to Bryan Barrett. He was a diversifal, because in him impinged events any of which might lead to the creation of a certain time - branch; a time - branch which must not be created if humanity in a far-distant era were to survive. The concept of worlds of if was not new to Bryan, nor was the idea of the future of man outside his thoughts. He dealt with the future, with the liberation of man from his bondage to tyranny. He was fighting for a future wherein man would know no poverty, no social backwardness; for a
time when man could come into his own, blossom forth and make true use of the boundless resources that were possible. Small wonder, then, that he could accept the idea of a man from the far future without trouble, and could decide to give ten years of his life to the cause for which this man from the future was fighting.
But already the first week of that ten years had become a nightmare.
“You’ve kept me here,” he now told the being, “three days, without any food except some stale cakes. Why?”
“Because the events of the Alpha Group are worked around your every probable action like a net. If you* left this house before morning, you would meet her.” His sharp-pointed face turned hard. “The psychological data I have on her is sketchy. I can control your actions. I cannot control hers, nor guess what they would be. And also, had you left here at any time during the last three days, you would have made an acquaintance whom you would not see again for eight, perhaps nine years.”
“The Gamma Group!”
“The Gamma Group. That acquaintance would show up as a probable event in the Gamma Group which would lead to tickets to a musical comedy in a New York—•” He stopped speaking, but Bryan Barrett, without knowing it, was watching him with cunning expression. The man from the future sneered. “Your obvious, unconscious desire to trick me would sicken even you, Bryan. Every word I speak is to your unconscious merely a clue to her identity. You must fight that.”
WEAT started on Bryan’s square, thinning face. He bowed forward, feeling as if he were about to burst. “I can leave here tomorrow morning?” His voice was muffled.
“Yes. And your way of life must change. You will go to Hannicut, editor of The Daily News-Star, and tell him you’d like to take that job he offered you last year.”
Bryan came to his feet in a blaze of anger. “No! You know why I didn’t take that job!”
“I know why. But it is still necessary for you to lose your integrity if we are to succeed. Go to Hannicut and tell him
you’re willing to falsify the news either by commission or omission. Also you will cancel your membership in the so-called radical organization, Freedom For AIL And in any other liberal organization you may belong to.”
He looked calmly down into Bryan’s stricken, agonized face. “I know what those associations mean to you—and in freedom-loving men everywhere. I am truly sorry. I conceive the future to be more important than this present, however. This, Bryan Barrett, is your first step to wealth and power. A financial gulf must be created as an additional precaution between you and her. A gulf that a poverty-stricken person can never cross. She is poor. She will always be poor...
IT was strange the way that nightmarish week turned into a month, that month into a year. Hannicut, editor of The Daily News-Star, performed a blunder from the viewpoint of the man who owned that newspaper and a hundred others throughout the world: he printed a story which told the truth about a recent labor-big business dispute. Hannicut’s boss fired him, and in elevating Bryan Barrett to the post warned him never to give labor a break, else he’d go the way of Hannicut.
“Take the job,” came the cold thoughts of the man from the future, and his name Bryan Barrett now knew—Entore.
Bryan got the first damp issue back from the press room the next day, and looked at it with sickened eyes. He left the office with his hat pulled low over his eyes. Newsboys were hawking the edition—big scareheads which told of another strike in the coal mines, and never mentioned one word about the strike a certain big-business corporation was pulling against the government. Which never said a thing about the filibuster a certain senator had pulled in Congress to defeat a prominority bill.
In the second week of Bryan’s editorship, he started to leave the office. Back in Bryan’s hotel suite, Entore, man from the future; sent another wordless command.
“Do not leave the office now.”
“No?” Bryan muttered the word from the graying mustache he now wore.
“No. Two men are waiting downstairs —two rowdies from the Freedom For All League. They are intending to throw bricks.”
Bryan’s fists clenched. “There are no rowdies in the Freedom For All League. No matter what the newspapers claim.”
“These men once knew you, when you fought tyranny together. They are law-abiding men. But something has snapped in them. In their eyes, you are a traitor. They could never punish you by law. They are willing to sacrifice their own lives if they can kill you.”
“Thanks.”
Bryan sank into a chair in the corner of his office. His head bowed, and he knew there was gray in his liair, gray that the last year had put there. Later Entore spoke again. Bryan left.
He had no sooner reached the street and signaled a taxi than Entore spoke again. “Do not take that taxi. Walk one block left. The Alpha Group. That taxi will have a minor street accident. Among those who gather in the crowd will be she.”
Bryan stood with his hand upraised. The taxi was sloping in toward him. His heart thudded. He felt a voiceless, impassioned longing, as if a mind, a human mind, were reaching across distances and touching his without saying anything. Her mind. Then he turned and walked one block left and took another taxi. He sat in the taxi, cold and graying, a man who was rising in power and wealth as the editor of a great metropolitan daily. A man who by all the rules of human conduct was a quisling of the worst sort. Yet, could they, his former friends and fellow fighters, know what hell he was going through now because he was looking farther into the future than they could ever hope to look? They were fighting against the corruptness of present civilization. Someday their fight would bear fruit in a nation-wide, and later on a world-wide, Utopia. Bryan Barrett had been forced to look farther ahead than that. To and beyond the year 800,000 A.D. They would never understand,
“Turn your head to the right,” came the command.
Automatically, Bryan turned his head. “Why?” he asked dully.
“The Gamma Group, seven years from now. Had you kept your eyes on the left
dow,
the
ii
side of the street, punctus nineteen of the Gamma group would have occurred. You would have seen a woman who resembled your mother so strongly that later on this week you would write a letter to her in your hometown, wondering- if she had been in New York. She would have answered quickly, wondering why you wrote so seldom, and telling you she hadn’t been in New York, but that, come to think of it, she would make the trip to see you. You would have met her in Penn Station, and in the excitement would have lost your billfold. A traveller would have found the billfold, taken the money, and dropped the billfold in a drawer at his home. Seven years later, his wife, cleaning house, would have found the bill-fold and returned it to you. You would have rewarded the woman. A few days later, you would meet her on the street; with her, a friend—”
“She!” Bryan interposed huskily.
ffVTES,” Entore said “The possibil-I ities of meeting her through the Gamma Group of events are the shadowy ones. One by one I am destroying the possibility of events both in the Delta and the Gamma Groups. But both will be relatively strong long after the Alpha Group no longer exists.”
Bryan went back to his hotel suite without eating. Entore was there, staring at him with impersonal, cold glance.
Bryan said, his hand still on the closed door, “I won’t be able to stand much more of this.”
Entore leaned forward on the console of his machine. “I, too, am sacrificing,” he pointed out.
“Are you?” Bryan’s eyes and voice tore across at him with sarcasm. “You can disappear back to your own time for an hour, a wreek, a year, if you choose, and return back to this same second of time without my being aware that you had gone. You have relief from the vigil. I have none. Ten years?” His laugh was brittle. “I’ll go crazy!”
Entore said nothing.
Bryan ground out, “You’d want me confined in a sanatarium, Entore. That would be similar to death, as far as destroying the Groups goes. No, thanks. I’ll hang
He looked back at Entore, as impersonally as Entore was looking at him. Bryan thought, as he looked at the assemblage of machinery. He’s shadozvy, vague. He has no real substance in this world. I can see through him and his machinery, a little. But he’s partly solid. I’ve touched the machine. I’ve had to push hard to get my hand through. Maybe a bullet . . .
He thrust the thought away, seeing in a flash what horrors it could bring. Kill Entore? Kill him? He who had, with his own science of a far future, assembled groups of event-data which alone could guide Bryan Barrett, diversifal, along the path he must take, rather than the path he would normally take? And yet, what if some day, in a burst of rage . . . ?
Bryan Barrett planned nothing of that sort. Another year passed, and another. The circulation of The Daily News-Star rose. Bryan could have pointed to Entore, when rich friends pointed to Bryan as one of the great editors of the times. Entore could look around corners, see what was coming from the future. Entore could scoop them all. If a war was going to break out, Bryan could have correspondents on the spot days before the event. If there was to be a mine explosion, Bryan could, if he wished, write the story ahead of time, himself. His salary rose to a fabulous figure. And he remembered, hollowly, Entore’s purpose. A financial gulf must be created between him and her. She would always be poor... .
Bryan Barrett did not consciously plan to kill Entore. It was merely that events pointed in that direction—events as sure and far-reaching as those events of the Delta and Gamma Groups which now and again Entore forced him to by-pass. There was the instance of the gun. Bryan was passing an alley-way in the fourth year of his association with Entore. Had it not been for the reflection from the store win-
Bryan would not have seen assassin. He ducked as the gun roared. With a continuation of the motion, he hurled himself into the alley, for a long second wrestled mightily with death. He jerked the gun from the man’s hands, threw him against the wall. His eyes widened.
Drake!”
“Okay, Bryan," the shabbily dressed man spat at him. “I’ll admit I was out to get you. I’ll stay here until the police come. And when they try me, I’ll tefl things to the courtroom you never would allow to get into your paper. How you and your boss put the pressure to bear, and disbanded the Freedom For All League.”
Bryan paled, dropped the gun into his pocket. “Drake,” he said, “get moving. Nothing happened. I was acting under my boss’ orders when I printed that anti-League propaganda. I wouldn’t have done it myself. But you wouldn’t understand. Go on.”
Bryan quickly turned away, walked in the other direction. By the time the crowd formed, both participants in the scene were gone. But something had snapped in Bryan’s mind. He walked faster, faster, as fast as his thoughts. An hour later, he burst into his suite, his hand in his pocket around the gun.
f*rj\NTOR£!” he snapped, taking two JO* stiff-legged steps toward the suspended creature. “All day, you’ve been in communication with me. Yet, as I was coming home from the office, somebody tried to kill me. Why didn’t you warn me about that?”
Entore’s face remained cold* “Were you killed ?”
“What does that matter? It was a lucky accident I wasn’t. A matter of a reflection in a window, something even you couldn’t have foreseen with your high and mighty science. Entore, you wanted me to die!”
Entore said nothing for awhile, his face a study. Finally, as if admitting something that had only hovered on the fringes of his mind “Bryan, I suppose we have both at last come to hate each other. But I have never once tried to lead you into any situation that would mean your death.”
“Except this evening!”
But already the force of Bryan's rage had died. Entore’s logic was indisputable. He hadn’t been killed. He felt the cold, hard mass of the gun in his pocket. He wondered if Entore knew about that. He wondered how deeply Entore could probe into his thoughts.
Entore repeated, with an abstraction that was entirely strange in him, “No, Bryan. No. I have never thought of that, never thought of consciously plotting your death, although it would free me.”
His eyes flickered; and Bryan, turning, went with the steps of an old man toward the bedroom. He took off the coat, hung it up. The gun was still in the pocket. Bryan tried to force the thought of the gun from his mind, to get the memory of it deep into his unconscious.
The gun stayed there in that coat for three years.
The Alpha Group was now destroyed. The Alpha Group, running thick with events which would have led him to her. And the Delta Group, too, was now so blocked off, and the probabilities of a meeting occurred in such long, involved chains, that Entore could destroy puncti merely by dictating to Bryan Barrett in such small matters as the color of a necktie, or a choice of dessert, or—well, how could the color of a necktie start a chain of events which would lead to her? This way: A tie bought hastily, worn once, disliked; given to the new hotel maid. The maid is making a quilt from old neckties, and several others are given to her. When she completes the quilt, she sells it to a small department store. The department store displays the quilt in the window. The maid informs Bryan, pridefully. On his way from lunch, Bryan feels obliged to stop by and look at the quilt. But he is in somewhat of a hurry, turns, looking at his watch, bumps head-on into her. • . . But Entore prevented Bryan from buying the chartreuse necktie.
In the eighth year, the Delta Group of events ceased to exist. They were now in the shadowy realms of the Gamma Group. Those events which were far-flung echoes of the past.
“There’s not much chance, now, eh?” Bryan queried.
“Not much chance.”
Bryan sat down. He was forty years of age, and the years had treated him harshly. He was tired, in mind and body. Fine lines had been etched deep in his face; strands of gray ran thickly through his hair. He was tall, and gaunt, and inclined to stoop at the shoulders, as from
a physical burden. He moved through life with a slow, firm tread which was not so much an indication of his bodily strength as of his will, which he whipped to action as he would a stubborn animal.
Entore had in no way changed.
“I would like,” Bryan muttered, in the voice of a man asleep, “I would like to meet her.”
“I know,” said Entore.
“Tomorrow night,” said Bryan, “I am going incognito to a public meeting of the so-called United Liberty Lovers’ League. It is a sham organization, masquerading under a name which indicates its opposite nature. I intend to expose the League in my paper.”
“No,” said Entore.
Bryan looked up, his face savage. “Yes! Eight years ago, I deserted every ideal that made me worthy of life. I was in some measure responsible for the disbanding of a league that was fighting corruption—the kind of corruption my newspaper has dealt in. I intend to make one strong bid for my self-respect.”
“You will no longer have your position if you print such a story. The man who owns the paper sponsors the organization you intend to expose.”
“That’s all right,” said Bryan, still savagely. He rose, pounding one fist with restrained emphasis into the palm of his left hand. “I’ve never gone against you, Entore. Never. Not in the slightest detail. This time I must. If this is a step that will create a chain of events which is undesirable, there’s still a way for you to lead me back to a safe path.”
Entore’s depthless eyes flickered. His small mouth turned slowly hard. “If you wish,” he said coldly. “But you must obey me in small particulars.”
Bryan nodded curtly.
BRYAN BARRETT never reached the
meeting hall of the sham organization United Liberty Lovers’ League the next night.
“Do not go by way of Columbus Circle,” Entore’s thoughts came.
Bryan leaned forward, spoke to the taxi driver, giving him another route, a route that led toward death. Bryan saw the moving van coming with ponderous sureness from a side-street, bearing down
broadside on the taxi. The driver cramped the wheel hard, screamed. The monster loomed, and Bryan moved, his nerves pulling at his muscles like reins holding the head of a spirited horse. He halfway rolled from the middle of the seat, with one foot kicked the door lever and shoved the door open. He threw himself from the taxi, hit shoulder first in the street, scraped his face on hard pavement. He lay like one dead. When he came to, he arose from the crowd that circled him, pushed his way through like a swimmer breaking water. Somebody tried to stop him, but he went, staggering at first, and then quickly.
He got back in another taxi. Entore did not speak to him once during that trip. He did not speak when Bryan came into the hotel suite. Bryan emptied his mind of coherence. He went into the bedroom, took off his tom coat. He put on another coat, and he tried not to realize that the gun was in that pocket.
Then he came out into the living-room and took a stance looking up at Entore.
“You tried to kill me,” he said.
Entore said coldly, looking at the blood on his face, “I am ignorant of all events after the taxi changed course. You deliberately closed your mind to me. However, I am glad you didn’t go to the League meeting. It would have set in motion a number of puncti which would have been hard to destroy. There now remains a chance—one bare chance that you will ever meet her. Once that punctus is destroyed, the Gamma Group will have been destroyed. You will be pleased to know— as I will be pleased—that our association can then be disbanded.”
Bryan started to shake inwardly. Then the trembling was transmitted to his outward person.
“Entore,” he had to whisper, “I know something now I didn’t know before. You’re a superman, and you’re a congenital liar. You can lie with a straight face when you know big events hang on your lies. More, you can convince yourself that your lies are true—and maybe that’s a valuable survival characteristic. Because you lied to me when you first appeared to me eight years ago.”
He gulped in air, tried to control his trembling. He spoke again.
“Most of what you said was true. I believe most of it But you just caught yourself up on one big lie. You knew how selfless I could be, because I believed in an ideal. You appealed to my selflessness by putting yourself in the same category. You told me it was your world of probability you were trying to destroy. Put that way, I could do nothing less than promise to collaborate with you completely. However, if by the destruction of one more punctus, the last chance of my meeting her is destroyed, then, in that same instant, your world will be destroyed, and you will be destroyed, too. You will cease to exist. Yet you speak of disbanding our association. If you spoke the truth, it would be disbanded automatically—and you would not have a chance to be pleased or displeased. Entore,” said Bryan, reaching into the pocket and taking out the gun, “you have tried to kill me once too often. You won’t get another chance.” He fired. He fired point-blank. And in his innermost heart he did not think he would succeed, did not want to succeed. The bullet struck Entore in the chest.
ENTORfi’S passionless eyes widened.
The delicate shadowy fingers clasped suddenly at the open hole in his chest that suddenly gushed with pink, barely discernible blood. He choked. Then he fell forward across the console of his machine.
“I am dying!” The hideous, incredulous thought-words ripped at Bryan’s brain. He saw Entore’s fingers scrambling at buttons on the control of his suspended machinery. The machinery and Entore suddenly disappeared, like smoke dissipated before a breeze. There was emptiness.
The gun dropped from Bryan’s fingers, as if it were a serpent which had struck him. He stood frozen for a long moment, icy cold horror pouring along the winding arteries of his body, pervading his brain.
“Entore!” he cried. “Entore! Come back 1”
But Entore would not come back. In his last moments, Entore had sent himself spinning back to his own time. Bryan sank, stupefied, into a chair.
Bryan left the hotel suite the next morning. He moved slowly, like a blind man who feels he is liable to stumble over the brink of a precipice at any moment. He
walked along the street listening for
Entore’s thought-voice.
Suddenly he stopped in mid-pace, turned, walked back, and then a block in the other direction. He started to board a bus, then changed his mind.
At breakfast, he ordered mechanically —then, in fright, changed the order completely.
When the day was done, he lay in bed, rigid with nervous exhaustion, knowing he had set himself an impossible task. Two years of this. And his battle against mechanical or impulsive actions was no substitute for Entore’s knowledge of puncti.
He thought of Entore, as he lay rigid in darkness. Entore had been a liar. And yet his lie did not matter. The same result, the preservation of humanity in the far distant future, would be achieved whether Entore’s world or the other world ceased to have being. The murder of Entore had solved nothing, but had left Bryan in a tangle of complexities from which there was only one straightforward path: suicide.
A month passed. And Bryan suddenly saw that insanity was another way out. He was surely growing insane. He was trying to control the minutiae of his existence, and doing so was like an entity in his own head, ripping his mind to shreds. He looked at his hand—large, bony—and it shook visibly. He looked straight down at the glass-top of his desk, and saw a hollow-cheeked, sunken-eyed specter. He sank back into his chair, closed his eyes wearily. And as he sat thus, he made his decision.
With the decision came a vast, flooding peace, a cauterizing of the disease that was growing in his mind. He opened his eyes as if he were looking on a new world. A world where he, Bryan Barrett, did as he pleased without censorship from Entore or from himself. He rose quickly.
On his desk, he heard the rustle of papers. He turned, filled with a drunken elation. The wind was flicking over pages of the rival newspaper on his desk much as a human hand could flick them over. Bryan put a paperweight on each corner, sank gloatingly into his chair. Events were flowing as they should flow, even in the small matter of wind blowing a newspaper.
Small ?
Something exploded in his brain like a bell struck violently.
He came to his feet, bent over the newspaper, staring at the advertisement which leaped with smashing impact toward his eyes. An advertisement smugly explaining the virtues of a musical comedy that was in its sixth month.
Years ago, Entore had said something about a musical comedy. Of an acquaintance who would later show up in the Gamma Group with tickets for a musical comedy. Only, Entore had destroyed that possibility by making certain Bryan did not make the acquaintance in the first place.
HE reached for the ’phone automatically. The wells of resistance had been pumped dry. That evening he sat in a rear theatre seat, far from the stage. And yet he saw her. Third act, second row, in the middle. Long before the show ended, he was standing at the stage-door, waiting for her to come out. She came soon. She halted in the door. Then she saw him. Without hesitance, she walked toward him and without saying anything, fell into step beside him and they walked down the street.
Their conversation until they 6at in the restaurant with the dinner plates cleared away was nothing that either of them would remember. Then it was Bryan who spoke.
“You’d never married ?”
“No. And you ?”
“Never. We’ve been kept apart.”
“I know,” she said quietly. “Entor6.” He looked across the table at her, unable to feel the shock of that suddenly imparted information. Her name was Ann. She was small and dainty of body, but the beauty that had been hers was fading into the serene depth of her eyes.
He said at last, “Entore came to you first, did he?”
“He did. And I refused him.”
“Why?”
“Because I was living in the present, and eight hundred thousand years from new is eight hundred thousand years.” He struggled with that logic, but there were implications in it which escaped him. “But,” he persisted, “the race of man
would die. It would end because of us.”
She leaned forward a little tensely, a little pleadingly, and the dark eyes flooded their inner beauty over her face so that he caught his breath. She wanted to explain something to him, but she had no words to say it. She sank back, mutely. He sat silently, holding himself in an iron control, and then it was that the barrier leaped up between them. For hours they sat there, talking of other things that neither would remember.
Finally she rose, quickly, holding her purse with both hands. “I must leave now,” she told him. He rose, too. Panic flickered on her face, and her hands—thin fragile hands—wound around the purse. “I have a feeling—as strong as the feeling that your eyes were on me from the audience—that if I leave now, we’ll never meet each other again. Do you want it that way. Do you really want it that way ?”
“It’s the way it must be,” he said, and it was as if his Nemesis, Entore, had forced the damning words from his lips.
A second after she had turned, walking so quickly that it seemed she was running away, turned and disappeared up the short flight of stairs toward the traffic-roaring street, he could still see the startled, destroying pain that wrenched her face. The incredulity that even the hope of the empty years of her life had been taken from her, and left a harrowing memory of nearhappiness only.
Only a second he stood there, remembering that tortured expression. Then a thunderbolt exploded inside him. This is the present, and eight hundred thousand years is eight hundred thousand years— as long as eternity, as meaningless!
“Ann!” he shouted—screamed the name as he stood on the street. She was not in sight. And he knew he would never see her again. The black, nauseous wind of self-hatred poured madly through his brain, and carried the mocking memory of Entore. The last punctus of the Gamma •Group of events had been dissipated. He was truly his own master again. He had the choice of facing straight ahead into the unwelcome future or—of fastening his mind on some more pleasant memory of the past, fastening it there permanently, and assuming the expression of an idiot.


By BRYCE WALTON
After attaining all conceivable goals, then what? The City was perfection, an ultimate city that left nothing to be desired and sought after* Bat tbe City was dying — for it had no purpose*
Illustration by MURPHY
LOW TINKLING music awakened
Amco. He stirred up out of semiconsciousness as the three-dim screen glowed purple. Lethargic nerves sharpened with intuitive sense of foreboding as the noble figure of the City’s Coordinator appeared in the three-dim radius.
The perfect, if characterless, features of
the Coordinator were taut with strain.
“We’re confronted by a serious crisis, Amco,” his voice said, and waited.
Amco frowned. A crisis? How could perfection be confronted by crisis? The City was an ultimate City, colossal, tiers on tiers of intricacy that left nothing desired nor sought after* But—
The last episode that could be termed crisis had been six centuries ago in 9400 when an armada of heavily armed ships from an alien cosmos tried an invasion of Dhoma and were annihilated. Could they be facing another such attack? If so, it was a form of offensive unpredictable by the most advanced Dhomastrial minds. He examined the Coordinator’s waiting face.
“I see that the word 'crisis’ is perplexing you, Amco.”
“Yes. I fail to evolve such a possibility/’
“Our city is dying,” said the Coordinator.
“How?” Amco asked. “How can perfection die?”
“That is the crisis,” said the Coordinator. “We have forgotten how to think. The City has reached a theoretical saturation point. The apparently insoluble problem of—no problems. Utter intellectual and neural satiation. We’re no longer motivated to exist. After attaining all conceivable goals, then what ?”
A little flutter of interest stirred in Amco’s bored mind. “We must think again,” he said. “Constructively.”
“Then why don’t you think?” said the Coordinator softly.
Amco paused blankly. Then: “Wha-what about?”
“That,” said the Coordinator, “is our problem. Think of something to think about.”
Amco felt the atavistic fluttering again. “We’ve achieved all possible physical attainments. Perhaps the answer is in the psychoneurel. The imagination.”
“Possibly, Amco. Any practical ideas to follow up with?”
“I—I—No,” said Amco in almost a whisper. “But it would be sad to see the City die.”
The Coordinator trembled with the extreme atavism that differentiated him so starkly from the norm. He raised a clenched fist in a gesture symbolic of a time so long buried that it stirred fear in Amco.
“It mustn’t die!” he hissed. “It mustn’t die!”
“But you said—” began Amco. The Coordinator interrupted:
“Yes. Rotting with inactivity and futility, the logical next step is death. If we are unable to discover any purpose in living further — end it. But I can’t admit
such a possibility. The plenum of all evolution mustn’t end in oblivion. The greatness of organic matter must be evolving toward some future other than nothingness. Flux must mean something besides an inevitable return to vacuum!”
“At least we have a problem,” said Amco.
“And the greatest problem of all,” said the Coordinator. “Because if we can find the true answer now, I shall dictate whether or not life as far as Dhoma is con-cerned should continue.”
Amco found himself tensing forward. “You mean if we could definitely determine that Dhomastrial life isn’t justified because it has no ultimate goal—you would destroy it?”
“Yes,” said the Coordinator hoarsely. “And why not?”
AMCO finally managed to say, “No reason, logically. Why go on living without an ultimate goal ?” His voice bore a note of resignation, but his eyes hinted at the anxiety he felt.
“That, then, is our problem,” enthused the Coordinator. “Is a worthy cause for continued Dhomastrial life determinable? If not, I’ll envelop Dhoma in the vibratory blasts that destroyed the invaders of 9400.” He paused, then added, thoughtfully, “Perhaps that will be the logical end of it.” Amco revealed what had occurred to him when the Coordinator first mentioned the crisis. He said: “The space-time converter. That is an answer. We could go into the plegarthic time flow called the future and find out.”
The Coordinator nodded. “I can think of no other way. Even if it is unsatisfactory. Though it’s been proven that the space-time converter operates satisfactorily no rationale has ever been reached as to
how it functions. The converter is
illogical.”
Amco nodded, too. “It is that. Perhaps it’s been wise, restricting the converter. But I see no other way.”
“You agree then to make the attempt, Amco? You are the only one I could trust. I know of no one else who still retains adequate sense of responsibility.”
“Of course,” Amco was saying, his heart pounding abnormally, and his face flushed. “Thank you, Amco. I put the future of


Dhoma in your hands then. Any questions?”
“One,” said Amco. “What if my findings are negative? You are definitely determined to destroy all Dhomastrial life?”
“Yes, Amco.”
Amco shrugged. He watched the three-dim screen fade.”
MCO stood beside the space-time converter on the periphery of a dead sea. A slight cold wind blew from it, whispering of a worldly loneliness. Away from the sea stretched an undulating plane of naked clay, unblemished, glossy, cruel. An anemic pale red sun shown fitfully through a slight dust-mist on the dead sea’s horizon.
Realizing that outside his plastic suit, the air was crackling cold, Amco shivered.
He had plunged two million years into the plegarthic flow.
Amco turned away from the barren area that had been a teeming sea. He faced the City. Yes. It still stood as he had left it. It seemed incredible that it was still intact. And yet, if it was perfect, how could it have been touched even by time?
But it appeared quite dead like the rest of Dhoma. He began walking toward it.
Fear crawled like a live parasite into his heart, as he approached the City. Fear coupled with its antecedents, anxiety and uncertainty.
The City, dead? His brain balked at such a possibility. Let the sea die. And the sun and all of Dhoma. Let space shrivel and freeze and the stars go out. But the City had- to go on living. It was too illogical that the humanoid and its inexhaustible ego should step off into oblivion. The City had to go on living.
But he could see no life. Nothing moved. Not the faintest aura suggestive of life. A coldness permeated the thin air, radiating from the gleaming plastoid of the City’s towering structures, gelid as from a corpse interned in eternal ice.
He found himself walking stiffly and fearfully through its familiar intricacies. He climbed other almost forgotten shafts and hurtled through the tubeways to remote sectors of the City. He stood, a pigmy among gigantic towers he had helped create two million years before, and felt crushed by grandeur, and vague terror.
5—Planet Stories—Winter
He had found the answer for the Coordinator. It was simple enough in its futile horror. The City had died. There was not a trace of its inhabitants. There was no clue as to their fate. The City might have been abandoned yesterday, or two million years ago. It didn’t matter. There was no life in it. There weren’t even ghosts of things or of memories. Only grey, thick, crushing silence.
He looked over collonades toward the red, ugly nakedness of the plane, toward the space-time converter. It was a minute silver blob waiting beside the barren sea. This was the answer he had been sent across the millennia to find. Somehow, it seemed unjust, irrational.
Death, only death.
He would return and tell the Coordinator.* The only cycle, the story of the plenum is merely an eruption that falls back as dust which some galactic wind would swirl away. A vacuum would efface the bloated plenum. And out of the vacuum would appear the dust again; and out of it would crawl colloidal mucous that would only return inexplicably to the dust again, t id the galactic wind would again—
Amco shivered. But in spite of the growing terror, he was grateful that he had found out the truth. Now the Coordinator could frustrate, defeat completely the aimless, ridiculous evolving that led to—emptiness. Then for no cause repeated itself. He was grateful that he could be a factor in blotting out the whole illogical process. He started back out of the City toward the space-time converter.
Then he heard, or rather sensed the radiations. A vague, almost imperceptible tickling of hidden mental potentials flooded his heart with hope.
He plummeted down into the City’s heart. Somehow, he knew there was still a form of life in the City.
The smooth, soft walls of plastic stretched away and disappeared in a mauve green distance. Amco stood humbled, sensing something of magnitude beyond his ken in the scene.
Dowm the endless hall, growing smaller and smaller with distance, bodies lay outstretched on slabs. Monochromatic harmonies of light oscillated soothingly and dreamily. Their forms were nude and their noble heads were enmeshed in mechanical
contrivances that eluded Amco’s technical genius.
As in a dream, he began walking down between the rows of corpses. Or were they alive? He couldn’t tell. Perhaps some elaborate form of burial with perfect preservation.
But the emotion reflected by every face differed. Differed in all the basic emotions of pain, joy, fear, pleasure, enlightenment, imbecility, perplexity, ecstasy, defeat, shame, grandeur—and all the endless shades of the itermingling of these and the gradations. Their hands lay open at their sides, and their eyes were closed. Yet the expressions on their faces were unmistakable.
The hall was sufficiently weird, bizzare and alien so that he was hardly surprised when he was accosted by the Robot.
The teleo-electronic man walked up and stopped in front of Amco. There was something unfriendly, almost inimical in his attitude. The emanations from the electronic brain seemed coldly unemotional :
“I suppose you must be destroyed,” the thought from the electronic brain impinged sharply on Amco’s consciousness.
“Why?” said Amco.
“I have been commanded to do so.”
“By them?” Amco motioned toward the rows of corpse like beings.
“Yes,” radiated the teleo-electronic man. “I was told to destroy anything that might intrude on the dreams of the sleepers. It’s very doubtful that they anticipated intrusion from something already dead. Why are you here?”
The thought penetrated Amco’s mind that no thought processes he might have could be given up to the robot according to Amco’s desires. His mind was completely open to the robot. He wanted to have a few thoughts to himself, but—
“Only the dead have that privilege,” said the robot.
And then the logical, the only realization Amco could maintain, flooded his brain: “But you cannot kill me. I am already dead.”
“My mind isn’t dialectical,” radiated the robot. “My mind lacks that human characteristic. You say you are from two million years in the past, and because of that, you are already dead and that I cannot kill
you again. Such reasoning means nothing to my type of thinking apparatus. It couldn’t become an obsession with me. My orders are to destroy you. I will carry out that order. If you are already dead, it won’t matter. If you aren’t then—well— you soon will be.”
AMCO, analyzing his emotions, found only a mild excitement. As an example of the world he had left, he proved its great need for change.
“Try to reason,” said Amco. “That command was given you to provide for the advent of aliens bent on harmful intent. I have no such intentions.”
“Why are you here?”
“I’m here to try and determine what course civilization has taken since my time. What course has evolution taken, if any? And if it has evolved, is there any conceivable goal toward which it is evolving?” The teleo-electronic man’s reaction radiations were confused.
Amco glanced at the rows of outstretched bodies. “Is this the end ? These Dhomans sleep. Is such sleep the ultimate end for two million years of struggle? If so, what is its nature and purpose?”
The teleo-electronic man radiated: “This is both the ‘beginning and the ending. Somewhat of a state of eternity. I am fitted to repair myself so that I will also be eternal. I administer to them, and repair myself, and we all live on and on.”
Amco’s consciousness expressed distaste at the robot’s vagueness.
“You must pardon me,” emanated the robot. “I love beauty of words for its own sake. Thought doesn’t interest me. I am not an intellectual, but an aesthete. I brood and am forced to introspect over long periods. You understand. Damn the loneliness! I’ve been a long time alone. A long time. Wait! Two million years! These sleepers have slept for almost that long. One million nine hundred and fifty thousand. Only a few years after you left your City.” The robot paused, then lost interest. “So lonely.”
Amco’s mind whirled confusedly. Two million years of sleep for these—these were the same who had inhabited the City when he—perhaps the Coordinator—perhaps —Why he had just missed becoming a living corpse himself by a few years. Now,
when he returned—his mind groaned with strain.
“Would you mind explaining all this,” he thought.
“No,” replied the robot. “Anything I tell you, you won’t remember anyway when you return to your own time. It will not have happened yet.”
Amco’s thoughts were ones of hopeless dismissal. The trivial cliches of the paradox of time travel. He had gone over them countless times with the Coordinator. Of course it was illogical. But it seemed to work. Perhaps three-dimensional logic was distorted when applied four-dimen-sionally. He was partially a four-dimensional object now, so—
“So, I’ll tell you of this hall of dreams,” radiated the teleo-electronic man dramatically. ...
“Dhomans have always been disatisfied with the shallow, sensory world. This is their last recourse to escape from this shallowness. You see, they have retreated into the boundless realms of the mind to live.
“There are no restrictions, no physical limits to the thought potential of the brain. This sleeper here just at my right proves that. He was the first of the sleepers. So he has lain here for almost two million years. Yet, it’s been no longer than a second, no longer than no time at all. In dreams there is no time. A moment may be forever. Forever doesn't exist—until you create it. Then you can destroy it with a thought. Strange isn’t it?”
Amco studied the indicated figure. “He doesn’t seem to be very happy about the whole thing.”
“Why should he be happy? Happiness grows tiring. Then he wills his consciousness into other emotions. He has lived them all. Countless combinations and sub combinations until it becomes an infinity of complexities, beyond computation—even for me. And then after all emotion has been tapped on this world, the sleeper creates in his mind another, and the process repeats itself. And then he may create worlds within worlds within worlds. It is an endless, deathless joy. An eternal newness of sensation. It’s the ultimate state, the final goal.”
Amco stood and looked into the mauve infinity of the hall. Somewhere in the past the Coordinator waited. But why return to him ? - The City did go on. It wasn’t destroyed. There was no need in returning. Why should he go back and miss an eternity of true perfection—the perfect free agency of living? You mill put me into this final sleep/' he radiated for the robot.
The robot stood as though undecided. Then emanated: “I will do it. I will forget their orders to destroy all intruders. You have broken the unbearable pattern of my loneliness, and for that you should receive something in gratitude. I will—” The robot half turned as though to fulfill his answer, then turned back slowly. “On second thought,” his mind said, “it isn’t what I must do.”
“Why not,” radiated Amco nervously. The robot looked at the sleeping dreamer at his right, and said: “Because it just dawned on me. Why shouldn’t I have this pleasure of living the ultimately perfect life? Listen. I’ll instruct you so that you can carry out the duties tliat I have to do now. You can administer to them from now on. And also to me. For a little while anyway.”
“You!” radiated Amco, breaking into vocal speech in his rage. “What makes you think you’re entitled to that honor? You were created for a specific purpose—to oversee the sleep of your creators. I’m like them. You’re only metal, a machine. No more nonsense. Come.”
THE teleo-electronic man stood in his mechanical coldness. “Perhaps they made a mistake when they constructed me. My mind is much more delicate, sensitive and human than they intended it should be. I think. But it seems to be much too late to rectify the error. I’m human. I deserve the same considerations as a human, as you. I’m even more deserving of the relaxation and beautiful dreams of the Sleep than you because I’ve served in the indescribable monotony of mechanical servitude for so long. So, I’ve definitely decided. You’ll take my place.”
Amco felt frustrated at the teleo-electronic man’s logic. His longings warped his own logic. “You were designed for this duty. I’d be vulnerable to fatigue, sickness, death, whereas you—”
The teleo-electronic man started moving toward Amco. “No. I'm going to make
—if they can be awakened at all.” I don’t know” radiated the elec-
ii
The arms that

an electronic body for your brain—a body of eternity like mine. I’ll construct this body according to your specifications— superficially that is.”
Amco backed away.
“Don’t make it difficult,” radiated the robot. “You can’t avoid the inevitable.”
OVERCOMING the metal man was out of the question. Physical violence of any sort was vague and abstract to Amco anyway. Resignation saved him from confusion. His only regret now was that he would be cheated out of the sleep. He had forgotten the Coordinator who waited for his answer as to the goal of evolution.
The teleo-electronic man was radiating: “If you’ll accept my proposition amiably, I’ll make a pact with you. We’ll alternate. You’ll administer the sleepers for a certain agreed on period of time, then I'll relieve you. Say at intervals of a thousand years.”
Amco decided suddenly that it would be more propitious for him if he tried to run away from the robot, get back to the space-time converter and go back to his own time. He was involving himself too deeply in aeons.
“No. I’ll not let you return,” radiated the robot. “My mind is set on the sleep.” “Wait,” said Amco, bursting into speech again. “I’ve just thought of something rather vast.”
“What,” radiated the robot.
“Have any of the sleepers ever awakened ?”
“Of course not,” radiated the robot. “Why should they?”
“If they’ve never awakened,” said Amco. “How do you know that all you've explained to me about their timeless paradise is really true? Their state resembles death. Too much so. Human kind used to delude themselves with the dream that they continued a kind of super life after they were dead. But alas, no one ever came back from paradise to prove it, and the paradoxical concept gradually died out. It was just wishful thinking. Exactly the same kind of suggestion has dulled your rationale mind.
“Before we go on with this conflicting egoism, let’s revive one of the bodies, if possible, and see if its consciousness, its mind, really still lives as you’ve insisted
that it does. Or whether only its physical body exists in some state of preservation resembling life. Perhaps all these countless bodies are no better than mindless pieces of cold storage.”
The robot backed away uncertainly. “I never thought of that possibility. It is quite possible, too. Perhaps their minds, their neural circuits don’t really function at all. None has ever awakened to tell.” Suddenly, the teleo-electronic man spun forcefully, and strode to the side of the first sleeper whom he had indicated before to Amco.
“We’ll revive this one,” he radiated.
“His sleep has been the longest. He was the first sleeper.”
“How are they awakened?” questioned
Amco “—
I
tronic man humbly. “That was never included in my training. Evidently it wasn’t planned at all.”
A sound startled Amco as a sudden sound might be expected to do in a place that seemed dead and soundless. A human moan. It rasped alienly down the hall, echoing eerily through the loneliness. The teleo-electronic man stared. The first sleeper was moving.
“None of them have stirred before, radiated the robot. “Look! His arms are
moving.
Amco was watching, hadn’t moved for so very long were moving now. The wrists flexed. The forearms quivered, then the whole arm moved up. Fingers spread, clenched, spread again. Lips parted, eye-lids flickered slightly.
The robot hastily removed the mechanism from the first sleeper’s head and bent over him. Amco felt the mystic awakening vapor of the sleeper’s brain.
Abruptly the first sleeper sat up and looked at them. Amco felt that he was looking into space and time. The eyes of the now awakened sleeper seemed circuitous, spinning pools of eternity.
“How long?” his extra-sensory communication centers radiated, weakly at first. “Where I’ve been, you know, there’s no time.”
“One million nine hundred and fiftv thousand years,” radiated the robot. “By
last table of reckoning, Arnim 500 A.S.” The first sleeper smiled. It was a thin, strangely alien smile for human lips. “One million nine hundred and fifty thousand years. I sense that such a span impresses you. To me it might have been a trillion years multiplied by itself, or the fraction of a second’s most minute fraction.
“Time, and matter, there is a point of difference. Matter is limited. It has a beginning, an end. I can’t explain it to you. You would have to travel through it all, as I have, before you could understand. Anyway, I am tired. It is an ultimate incredible weariness.”
The sleeper understood. Amco was lost. He was thinking frantically, how could one be tired of eternity?
“Because I have experienced everything,” said the sleeper. “I have gone back to the first of the beginning. I have been into the future where it merges with the beginning I found in the past. I have floated through space that seemed limitless, but I found that it only eventually became the beginning I found in the past. Well, in all the dimensions, in all the spaces and times and imaginative worlds, I found only one path—it led back to the beginning. But I have had the foresight to save one world for the last.”
Amco was aware of an emptiness creeping through his heart.
“But what could remain, sleeper?” he murmured.
The sleeper continued: “My experience is completely inconceivable to you. The splendor of traveling as light does, effacing space, bending as it bends, repeating itself into endless prisms of existence. The swirling of the electron, or the frantic swimming through the plasma of monsters. I have lived and relived all the complexities of all the combinations. But I’ve anticipated the ultimate. I’ve prepared for it. I saved what might prove to be the final eternal moment for the last.”
The sleeper closed his eyes and relaxed. His lips moved slightly. “You know what to do, Robot.”
Amco backed away. He swallowed hard, and brushed his eyes. He turned toward the teleo-electronic man—
“Odd,” it radiated, “that oblivion, or death, or whatever symbol is used to describe the Unknown, should be the final and most desirable world of all worlds.” Amco looked dazedly about, still backing away from the inert sleeper. “Yes. Yes, odd. Very odd. You will let me go now, let me return to my own time. I don’t desire the fate of this sleeper, and I’m sure you don’t. Let me return.”
The teleo-electronic man nodded. “It does seem futile now. You can return.” Amco did not answer. He was running, running frantically away from the future.
At least he had found the true, ultimate goal. Oblivion. Now he could inform the Coordinator of that fact. He would be the instrument through which all this impossible flow termed life would be terminated—at least for Earth and for his own particular species of rational life.
Why evolve a few million years more only to decide that oblivion was preferable ? One could find that immediately. The sleeper, through the robot, had brought about his own death because he had learned the ultimate truth.
«A F course, you can’t remember, V-/ Amco,” the Coordinator said. “We foresaw that. It’s one of the paradoxes of time travel. But now comprehending its principle, I anticipated illogical results in its effects. I thought, or rather hoped, you would remember.”
Amco shrugged. “There is some kind of vague, indistinct memory in my mind. I’m convinced of that. But—I can’t grasp it. Wherever my discoveries are, they are important to us. They would have answered our problem and given us a definite course of action.”
The Coordinator turned. “We still have a problem at least to work on. That’s more than wre had before. New worlds must be devised for the senses and the mind. This one is about exhausted.” Amco nodded. “Meanwhile,” he said, “I’ll try constantly to recall what I discovered in the future. Surely some sensory impression was made.”
Amco isolated himself in laboratory and worked in exhaustive auto-psycheometry. And after many centuries succeeded in uncovering the buried memory. The date of his self destruction, through the teleo-electronic man, was Arnim 500 A.S.

MARK TRAVERS hoisted himself
up from the floor. He leaned against the supply locker, rubbed his aching jaw where the big man’s fist had just landed, and grinned ruefully.
The big spaceman didn’t grin. He faced Mark straddle-legged and snapped, “Who are you?”
‘‘Mark Travers.” His smooth gray eyes surveyed the man’s bulk. He thought he could handle him, but filed it for future
w
reference when he saw the neutro-gun in the other’s fist.
“Travers, eh. A blasted stowaway! You come aboard at Marsport?” “Obviously.”
“How?”
“It was easy,” Mark shrugged. “Your ship was small, dark, and carried no insignia. I watched your men loading supplies .secretly. Furthermore, you hadn’t filed your destination with Central Bureau. Just the kind of set-up I wanted.” “You know a lot,” the big spaceman's eyes went hard. “Are you a sneaking I-S-P? Never mind, I’ll see for myself!”
■	j
He came a step forward, and his gun got playful with the third button on Mark’s plasticoid shirt. Expertly the man’s fingers went over him.
“Careful, there, I’m ticklish!”
“So’s the release on this trigger, so just stand still.”
Mark stood still. The search revealed no papers or identification of any kind.
“I’m not I-S-P,” Mark told him sincerely. “If I were, do you think you’d ever have lifted gravs from Marsport?” “Okay, fella. I’m Mai Driscoll. Sorry I had to clip you so hard, but you never should have pointed that contraption at me when I stepped in here. So help me, I
thought it was some new kind of weapon.” His eyes narrowed. “What is it?”
For a mere second Mark hesitated. He glanced down at the small, stub-lensed box which he had clung to.
“Why, it’s—only a camera. New type, invention of my own.”
Driscoll nodded. “Come on, stowaway. We’ll go up and see Janus. No skin off my teeth, if he wants to keep you aboard.” They stepped out of the room and along a corridor, bracing themselves against the forward thrUst of the rocket engines. “Who’s Janus?”
“Our Commander.”
“And what if he doesn’t want me aboard?” Unobserved, Mark pressed a hidden stud in the black box. Tiny but powerful coils hummed to life, quickly ascended the scale to the inaudible. Camera? Mark smiled to himself and hoped none of the men here knew anything about cameras!
“You know the space-code on that,” Driscoll answered his question. “If it is so desired, stowaways are tossed into space.”
Mark racked his brain. “I don’t remember that in the Interplanetary Code!” Driscoll turned, grinned at him. “Who’s talking about Interplanetary Code? We make our own!”
JANUS was in a forward cabin poring over charts on a glass-topped table. Three other men were lounging there. Janus was six-feet-four, with bulk to match. He had flaming red hair and an outlandish full beard that made a vivid splash against the drab gray of his insulated tunic.
He scowled fiercely as the two men

entered. Driscoll pushed Mark forward.
“Found this stowaway in the supply room. Says his name is Mark Travers. I don’t think he’s I-S-P, though.”
Janus’ deep-set gray eyes seemed to bore through Mark, then they flashed to the black box.
“What’s that?”
“New-dcsign projection camera. It—” “Put it here,” Janus indicated the corner of his desk. Mark did so with some reluctance. This man was no fool!
The other three men had come down off their bunks and stood there watching. One of them, Mark noticed, was a Martian. “Now. Why are you here?”
“You seemed to be the sort of men I wanted to join up with.” •
“I said why?”
Mark wondered if this man would believe him. Pie didn’t think so. Nevertheless, he’d already made up his story so he drew a long breath and told it:
“I was with Tri-Planet News Service working out of Chicago. I happened to uncover a huge spacer contract graft. I got the names of the higher ups, photostatic copies of incriminating documents— everything. But the men involved happened to be too high up; my story was squashed before it ever reached the wires. I would have been, too, permanently, but I escaped to Mars—”
Janus was laughing at him behind that red beard. Mark was sure of it. He shrugged and didn’t attempt to go on with the fabrication. It had been a good try, anyway.
Janus said dryly: “Now tell me the real story. Or shall I tell you? You received one of the typical BINWI offers You’re running away to cool off, or maybe to keep your invention out of their hands. Is it this—ah—camera?” Janus glanced at the compact box lying there.
“That’s right,” Mark admitted, marvelling at this man. “They made me several offers but I wouldn’t come through. The last one was ‘typical’, all right—backed up by some of their hired thugs.”
“Why didn’t you tell me this in the first place ?”
“I wasn’t sure how you felt about the BINWI.” Mark was still wary.
“The same as you do, although I’ve never had any contact with them personally. My special peeve is the Tri-Planet Council, and the BINWI is a subsidiary. Bureau for the Investigation of New and Worthy Inventions. A laugh, ain’t it?” Mark didn’t think so. “That bureau,” he said, “is an octopus preying on the inventive genius of three planets! Their spies are everywhere, moving unseen, biding their time. You know the new anti-grav deflectors the Patrollers are using? A man named Anton Kramer worked that out. He had it near perfection when he suddenly disappeared. A month later the deflectors came on the market.” Mark’s voice was bitter. “There’ve been dozens of other cases. The BINWI usually gets what it wants, even if it means murder.” Janus nodded. “There’s a man aboard who’ll agree with you on that! Professor Brownell. Perhaps you shall meet him— later.” He turned his gaze to the four crew members. “All right, men, how about Mark Travers? Do we accept him as one of us? A vote is in order.”
“How do we know he’s not a BINWI spy himself?” asked a small man with piercing black eyes. “He seems to know a lot about ’em!”
“I’m convinced he’s not, Ferris. We covered Brownell’s trail too well for that. Let’s have the vote.”
The “ayes” were unanimous and suddenly these men were friendly, smiling, as they stepped forward to shake Mark‘s hand. They were good handshakes, firm and calloused. Only Ferris’ was reluctant.
“There’s one thing more,” Janus said quietly. “We’ll need your picture for our —shall we say—rogue’s gallery? I insist on that. Perhaps I can take it now— with your camera.” He reached to the black box on his desk, lifted it carelessly up.
MARK found himself staring full into
the stub-nosed lenses. Sudden sweat broke on his brow. His gaze lifted and met Janus’ gray eyes, straight and steady upon him.
“Wait!”
“What? Not camera shy, are you?” Janus’ fingers seemed to fumble, but his gaze never left Mark’s face.
“The lens isn’t set! It—it’s special, you know.” Mark stepped forward. His limbs seemed wooden. He took the box from
Janus’ hands, and pretending to adjust the lens, his thumb found the hidden stud and released it. The hum of the inner coils descended the scale again, became audible for a split second but only to Mark's ears; then they were dead.
He let out a slow breath, handed the box back. “Okay now. Shoot.”
Janus waved it awray. “Oh, well, it can wait. We’ll get it later.” He came around the desk, thrust out his hand. “Welcome aboard, Travers! You're one of us.” Mark suddenly knew that Janus knew his secret . . . but somehow he wasn’t worried. He wondered if any of the others had noticed the by-play; moreover, he wondered what being “one of them” meant. . . .
He was soon to know. At that moment a voice sliced through the radio.
“Callisto calling! Earth-Station Six on Callisto! We have had you in our beam for the past twenty minutes. You are out of bounds and you display no insignia. As this is a violation of the Space-Code, you wrill go into a drift immediately and await the Patrollers who will escort you to Callisto for investigation! Refusal to obey constitutes outlawry against the Federation, and the Patrol will act accordingly!” The men weren’t startled. If anything they were amused. The one named Deth-man simply straightened away from the radio and his hard, square face broke into a grin.
“Think of it, men, we’re being outlawed! Now ain’t that one for the books?”
The face of Ral Kaarj, the Martian, was blank and leathery. His heavy-lidded eyes blinked once or twice, but only his incongruously high-pitched voice revealed his emotions.
“Tri-Planet Federation!” he shrilled. “Out of bounds! By the red tails of all the Oogs on Venus, ain’t anyone supposed to venture beyond the asteroids ?”
“Not without sanction of those gray-beards in the Council,” Janus said, “and the Earth Corporations who are the real power. You know how they try to squelch men like us, free-footers who won't play ball with ’em.” He flicked open the communicator to Brownell in the control room. “How about it, Prof? Get that message?” “Yes,” Mark heard a voice reply. “All right, we’ll go into a drift. Let the Patrollers come, we’ll give 'em a show!”
“Right! Need any help?”
“No, but keep the communicator open. And take a look in the V-panel if you want.” Brownell actually seemed pleased!
Janus clicked on the visipanel, turned the magnifying dials. Callisto was seen in the swimming blackness of space with the huge bulk of Jupiter as a backdrop. Under Janus’ sure lingers the scene expanded, came nearer.
Minutes passed; then they saw six Patrollers speeding out to meet them. Brownell had cut rockets and they were in a drift now, waiting.
Waiting for what, Mark wondered. These Patrollers were speedy ships and deadly, equipped with atomo-bombs, dis-rays and magnetic beams! He shifted nervously.
The Patrollers came very near. Then they broke formation, arraying themselves three on each side of the outlaw ship. Magnetic beams, pale green and swirling, reached out to touch the hull. They fastened there tenaciously. In this manner they began the route back to Callisto.
Even Janus seemed a little worried now. He turned to the communicator.
“How about it, Professor? Those beams are powerful? Think you can slip out?”
“Wait and see; I promised a show, didn't I? Tell you what, though, better break out the acceleration harness!”
THESE were suits within suits, double layers of tough plasticoid. Mark stepped into his, opened the pressure valve that forced air between the two thicknesses. The outer one ballooned, giving a grotesque, roly-poly appearance. He bounced hard against the wall to test it.
“Better open them full,” Janus advised. They were ready. They stood against the far wall and watched the screen across the room. Callisto was looming. They’d soon be within its gravity.
Ferris, standing beside Mark, said in a low voice: “What kind of a news-man are you, Travers? Y'oughta be getting pictures of this. Make swell release stuff when you get back to Earth.” His tone was mocking.
Mark felt a growing dislike of this man. He suppressed a retort, said curtly instead: “Too late now.” He had placed his
“camera” safely in an inside pocket.
The Patrollers’ magnetic beams still towed them along at terrific speed, setting up a slight vibration in the walls.
Suddenly there was a new kind of vibration. Mark didn’t know what it was. Certainly not rocket tubes.
“Get set!” Janus warned.
Someone muttered: “If he slips out of six magnetic beams—” but that was all. A fierced surge came beneath their feet, and Callisto seemed to leap at them. Within seconds a ghastly nausea gripped their insides. The ballooning suits were pressed so flat against the wall it became impossible to breathe! Their hearts pumped sluggishly, and a gray veil began to form before their eyes. . . .
These were men so accustomed to hardships that space-acceleration meant nothing, but now they were experiencing something new in acceleration. They felt as if their entrails were being compressed into atoms!
Mark could barely see the screen now. The way Callisto was rushing at them he felt sure the planet was going to blank them out. He tried to shut his eyes, but even his eyelids wouldn’t move! Then Callisto slipped off the screen, and Mark knew they must have made a sharp parabola. Two of the Patrollers were glimpsed far behind, reaching out futilely with dis-rays.
Even as he struggled for breath, Mark wanted to laugh; but the desire left him suddenly as the tremendous bulk of Jupiter loomed. If they escaped that gravity—
And they did. They came close, but their parabola tightened, then they were pulling away. Speed remained constant as Jupiter faded. Mark could breathe again but he ached through every inch of his body. He could only think wearily.
This, he thought—this meant they must have accelerated to the sixth, seventh or even eighth magnitude!
II
PHILLIAS BROWNELL was a tough
little character. He still breathed with difficulty as Janus unstrapped him from the pneumatic scat, and bis face was ashen; but he hoisted himself up to his full stature of five feet five and his gray hair
bristled. He went to work over the control console, jabbing hard at gleaming buttons and adjusting the complex set-up. By now Jupiter was fast fading in the darkness behind them.
“All right,” he announced finally, “we’re on robot control. We can rest easy for a while.” He sneered in the direction of Jupiter. “We showed ’em some speed, eh? So they want my Frequency Tuner, do they? Let them come and get it! The dolts, the moronic interfering meddlers!” Janus plainly showed his relief, as he winked at Mark, who said, “That was some chance you took. Suppose it hadn’t worked ?”
“But it did work! That was the final test, and it was necessary. I had to know how it would react against the beams.” Mark ventured a question. “Frequency Tuner? Is that what gave you the acceleration ? I knew it wasn’t rocket power!” Brownell turned piercing black eyes upon him. “Eh? Janus, who is this?” Janus vouched for Mark, explained his presence aboard. He added: “The Bureau’s after an invention of his, too. A camera.” The Professor was startled. “Did you say a camera ? Since when do they—”
“Ah, but Mark’s is a very special camera.” Janus smiled maddeningly, but in the next instant was clapping a friendly hand on Mark’s shoulder. “Don’t worry, Travers, your secret’s safe with us. We don’t ask questions. You’ve a right to know our destination, though; come on, I’ll show you.”
They repaired to the chart room, where Janus indicated a moving red line on a glass-encased chart of the solar system. Other lines were being traced, too, at various angles to their trajectory.
“The red line is our present trajectory. The others are the orbits of the planets. See, there’s Jupiter behind us; notice how close we came.”
Mark nodded. Already in his mind’s eye he was extending their present parabola. Distances between these outer planets were vast beyond imagining! Saturn was just in sight, but at their present speed they would probably cross its orbit far in advance of the planet. Then came Uranus,
and next Neptune. The space between Neptune and Pluto was vaster than all. Mark felt just a little staggered. There
was no known record of men having come this far! Not beyond Jupiter, in fact.
He turned to Janus. “How far do we
go ?”
“All the way.”
“Pluto?”
“Beyond.”
Mark thought that over. “There’s no planet in our system beyond Pluto!”
“But there is. Planet X. An eccentricity in the orbit of Pluto indicates there must be a planet beyond. For years astronomers have known this, but no telescope has been able to pick it out.”
Mark grinned weakly. “So that’s where we’re headed. I guess you know it’d be awfully easy to overshoot a mark like that r
“Not with the Frequency Tuner. I understand very little of it, but the Professor assures me it’s a directional finder as well as a power unit.”
“Sure, sure. And assuming we locate Planet X and manage to land—what do you expect to find there?”
JANUS’ eyes were flecked with dancing lights. “What do we hope to find? George Ketrik! And if you know the man at all, you know that means adventure and riches.”
Ketrik! Mark’s mind went back. He began piecing together things he had heard, fragments and rumors. The man Ketrik and his amazing exploits had become almost a legend!
“But I have heard,” Mark voiced slowly, “that Ketrik died! Plunged into the sun while trying to negotiate a landing on Vulcan.”
“You don’t really believe that? Sure, every few years you hear those stories, but Ketrik always shows up again.” Janus sighed. “You know, I’ve almost come to believe that he’s not human. Where other men go—men like us—they find that Ketrik has been there first. I’ve personally made two fortunes, and lost them, in following his trail!”
Mark was skeptical. “But even he wouldn’t dare try for Planet X! He hasn’t the speed that we have. It would take him—”
“Ketrik would dare anything! Why, six months ago I heard that he was planning this venture; that’s why we’re here.
We five men pooled our savings to finance Brownell’s Frequency Tuner and build this spacer, in secret, of course. Sure—it would take Ketrik maybe three months to reach Planet X in some dilapidated little rocket-powered craft. We’ll make it in three days—but I’ll wager lie’s already there!”
“With the whole populace kow-towing at his feet, most likely.” It was Driscoll who spoke as he entered the room, followed by the other men. “Sure, I’ll back the luck of Ketrik every time!”
Dethman shook his head. “Planet X is probably uninhabitable. But I’ll bet my last pair of socks Ketrik’s located a cave of diamonds, or maybe a platinum vein. Toss him in a Venusian sink-hole, he’d come up wreathed in swamp pearls!”
“Fle’s that sort,” Janus agreed. “It was platinum on Mars, cinnabar on Mercury, plumes on Venus. By the way, I got in on the plumes—made a fortune. And the other time I saw Ketrik—”
“I recall the time he showed up at the Venusian Prison Swamp,” Driscoll put in. “One day he wasn’t there, the next day he was—just like that. Inside a week he had organized a group of us for a getaway attempt. Hundreds of others had tried it and failed. Well, he led us safely across two hundred miles of swamp, supposed to be impassable. Know what was on the other side? A space-ship, all waiting and ready. He just wanted to prove it could be done, I guess.”
“I only saw him once,” Kaarj shrilled eagerly. “That was on Deimos. He had discovered the secret shrine of the Dei-mian ancients. He came out of that shrine decked from head to foot with blazing jewels—but the Deimians were waiting for him. They’re a blood-thirsty tribe, and they were plenty angry. . . .”
“I never heard this story before,” Janus said. “What happened?”
“I stayed a safe distance away in my spaceship, watching and this is what happened. Ketrik made them a speech! I swear it! Fie climbed up on a block of stone in full range of their weapons—and do you know what his speech consisted of? The entire first chapter of the ‘Advanced Principles of Space Navigation’. He quoted it most violently. Those Deimians didnt understand a word of it, but I swear to
you, when Ketrik had finished they weren’t angry any more! They cheered him! He walked calmly over to his space-cruiser and blasted away, jewels and ail!”
“I came across him once on Mercury,” Dethman contributed. ‘'The barbarians from the dark side were warring on the race inhabiting the twilight strip. Well, if it hadn’t been for Ketrik, the whole colony would’ve been wiped out. They almost made a superman out of him, wanted him to marry a thousand wives to make sure he’d leave plenty of his descendants there. And by Jupiter, he almost did! When I left he was still there, married to ten wives—or was it twelve?”
Mark was enjoying all this. He looked to Ferris, who seemed to be the only one without a story to tell. Ferris lit a venomous Venusian cigar, and sneered:
“I don’t hold with all this hero-worship, and I don’t believe more’n a tenth of it. Don’t think we’ll find Ketrik out here either. Fve sunk a year’s takin’s from my placer on Mars into this venture—” “And afraid you won’t get it back, is that it?” Driscoll snapped. “Why, that placer you’re yapping about was Ketrik’s in the first place, and you know it! Sure, you’d rather hide out some place and manufacture more Frequency Tuners.” “We’ll do that, too, once we make a strike,” Janus said thoughtfully. “We’ll equip a whole fleet with ’em, and really exploit the outer planets. That should give that addle-brained Earth Council something to really think about!”
ON THE third day they crossed the orbit of Pluto. Mark w’as in the control room with Janus and the Professor. The latter pointed to a thin thread of liquid helium in the directional-finder, surging slightly off center.
“Pluto’s the nearest body now. It must be heavy, to drag us that way.” He gave a touch to the Tuner’s impellator, and the helium line came back to center as their acceleration increased.
The Sun had long since been a pinpoint of light. The darkness ahead was no different from the darkness behind, but the men felt infinitely more alone. Behind were the known planets. Ahead was X— the unknown. It might be days more, or merely hours. No one slept now.
It was only hours later when the Finder began acting erratically again. Brownell, who seemed indefatigable, took over the controls from Janus. But he didn’t try to adjust direction now.
“It’s Planet X,” he said. “Has to be! We’ll let the Finder take us right there!” He switched on the visipanel and adjusted the lens to fullest power.
“It must be a dark planet,” Mark pointed out. “Certainly the Sun’s light doesn't reach it. Howr do you hope to see it in the panel?”
“Ordinarily I’d say you were right,” Brownell nodded. “But look! There it is!” Barely discernible on the screen, they saw a vague pin-point of light. Brownell glanced at the proximity indicator and gasped.
“Over three million miles—it can’t be! Not the way it's pulling us now. Unless,” he added thoughtfully, “it has a gravity grab equal to that of Jupiter at half the distance! Good Lord!” He tested instruments, gave experimental side thrusts with the Tuner, but they came back irresistably into the pull of the planet ahead.
Hour after hour they came nearer. The planet resolved into a dark disc with a peculiar surrounding halo.
“I don’t like it,” Janus reflected the thoughts of them all. “That light—where does it come from? Not the Sun! The Sun doesn’t even touch Pluto!”
“Maybe it has a Sun of its own,” ventured Kaarj. “On the other side”
“If it does, the sun moves right along with it in it’s orbit!”
“You can tell from here that the planet has no axial rotation,” Brownell announced. He looked a little worried. “This gravity drag is getting worse. We’re accelerating. Better get into your harness.” He set the example, and the men followed. “I think I can control it with the Tuner in reverse, but it pays to be safe. You never can tell, out here; these are strange conditions.”
The planet was looming fast. The Professor’s hand on the deceleration lever revealed the strain he was under. Below them now they glimpsed vast dark plains, and as they came nearer, huge stretches of forest. Mountains loomed. Far ahead was faint light, a few miles of “twilight strip” much as that on the planet Mercury.
The Professor was heading for this strip but Mark didn’t think they’d make it. They were losing altitude with sickening speed. Mark had a final vision of the little Professor tugging desperately on the deceleration lever, of huge greenish-gray plants coming up beneath them.
Then a rending crash, a confusion of flying legs and arms. Just before Mark blanked out he knew their ship was still ploughing forward.
Ill
HE CAME back to consciousness with
a feeling of intolerable weight pressing him down. It was his own weight, he discovered as he tried lifting his head to look around. It was a terrific strain and he let his head fall back.
None of the men were seriously injured. The bulging harness had saved them. They called out to each other, but couldn’t move except to roll their heads from side to side.
‘‘Professor, did you say a gravity equal to that of Jupiter?” Dethman called out.
“That, or more. And yet this planet has a diameter of scarcely a few hundred miles! Strange!”
“Strange, he says,” came from Driscoll. “What do we do now, just lay here for the rest of our lives ?”
“Let’s see you do anything else,” Kaarj said drolly.
“Not me,” Janus spoke. “You think I’ll let this pee-wee world get me down? If I can only get to that Tuner control.”
“I’m afraid this is one kind of gravity it won’t counteract,” Brownell admitted ruefully. “This world must be condensed as tightly as a white dwarf star! A cubic inch of matter weighing hundreds of pounds!”
Mark twisted his head around, saw Janus’ huge frame struggling to move. He was a powerfully-built man, he’d be the one to do it if anyone did. Slowly, minutes at a time, he managed to drag one leg under him and then the other. lie brought his hands into position. Sweat broke on his brow as he rolled himself over on all fours. Then with a terrific effort he hoisted himself erect!
He stood there, a straddle-legged, red-bearded giant. But only for a second. His legs buckled. He managed to hurl him-
self toward the starboard port, as he slid
downward.
“At least I can see out now,” he gasped. “We just did reach the twilight strip. There’s a whole forest of great big green things, thirty feet high. Sort of like cactus, fiat and spiny.”
“They must have helped break our fall!”
“You said it! I can see a strip for over a mile, where we mowed ’em down. Hey! Look! For the love of—” Janus’ voice dwindled off in amazement.
“Damn it, man, how can we look? What is it? What’s out there?”
“People! Dozens of ’em! They’re coming out of the forest. Oh-oh, they’ve spotted us. But they’re not coming over. They just stand there jabbering and pointing.” “People on this world,” Brownell muttered his amazement. “What are they like, Janus? Describe them!”
“They look kind of savage to me. Squat and furry, but they stand erect. Their legs are thick and heavy like an elephant’s.” “Yes, that would be natural on this world. The terrific gravity.”
“Gravity doesn’t seem to bother them,” Janus went on. “Let’s see, now. Yes, in all other ways they seem to be low-evolutionary humans, except . . . good Lord!” “Except what? Damn it, Janus, go on!” “They have knobs!”
“What ?”
“Knobs! Growing right out of their foreheads. And they’re lit up—the knobs, I mean. Sort of a soft white light.” “Another logical development of nature,” said the Professor. “They live on the dark side, so their bodies manufacture the necessary light. Are they armed ?”
“They are. Just crude spears and clubs, though, so I guess we’re safe enough in here. Oh, oh, here they come. I think they see me!”
Twisting his head around, Mark could barely see a corner of the window where Janus lay. In the twilight gray beyond he glimpsed the horde of barbarians rushing at the ship. It seemed fantastic that they could move in such gravity, fantastic that any creature could walk.
One of them hurled a spear with deadly accuracy. It struck the window and glanced away. Others crowded around, pounding at the glass with clubs, clamoring to get at Janus who lay just beyond.
“Professor,” Janus said wryly, “this isfflt very pleasant. Are you sure that glass will hold?”
“Don’t worry. It will take more than their pounding to crack four inches of crystyte.”
“Hope you’re right.” A moment later Janus exclaimed, “Hey, some of these babies have electric rifles! Good Lord, I see—one, two, three—at least half a dozen of ’em! Wait a minute, though—they’re only using them as clubs. The metal parts are corroded. Why, those are the old-type electric rifles popular on Earth two hundred years ago!”
“You must be having delusions,” came from Ferris.
“No, I’m not. I’ve seen that type of rifle in the museums. Now how do you suppose they got ’way out here?”
For a few minutes there was silence, broken only by a faint ringing sound as the clubs beat against the thick crystyte. Then Janus announced:
“Here come more of ’em out of the forest. They’re bringing up the reserves. Hey, this might be serious! They have a new kind of weapon.” He peered for a moment into the grayness. “It’s a huge thing, seems to be a sort of combination catapult and cross-bow. I don’t like the looks of it ”
A minute later the first shot came. It struck the spaceship very close to the window. There was a muffled explosion, and a flashing blue flame.
“By all that’s holy—explosives! Powerful stuff, too. These babies aren’t as barbarian as they look!”
“We’ve got to get away from here some way.” Brownell was really worried now. “Janus, do you think you could make it to the controls? Perhaps by dragging yourself—”
“I’m sure gonna try it! Wait a minute, though—they’re not going to bother us any more. They’re scared!”
“Scared of what?”
“Damned if I know. They’re staring off to the right, jabbering and pointing. Hah! There they go, they’re running away!”
Driscoll said, “What did you do, Janus, make a face at ’em? That red beard of yours is enough to scare anybody!”
“Something’s coming.” Janus was
straining his neck now, his face flat against the glass. “I think I can make it out . . . yes . . . holy blazing comets! What kind of a world is this? Get away from there, you! Hey—cut that out!”
Janus’ voice had risen to an excited pitch. “Get set, men—I think we’re leaving here!” The ship gave a sudden lurch and Janus rolled backward. His head hit the floor hard—enough to stun him a little.
And now their ship was moving! Not upward. It seemed to be dragging forward over rough terrain. In this tremendous gravity, every slightest jolt bruised them horribly. They could only lie there and take it. After five minutes of this their muscles seemed pounded to a pulp, despite the inflated suits still encasing them.
Then as suddenly as it had begun, the movement stopped. There was ominous quiet.
Mark, on the brink of unconsciousness, thought he was dreaming when he saw Professor Brownell leap to his feet! Now the other men were stirring. They rose dazedly. Gravity was normal!
They crowded excitedly around the windows. Outside was bright daylight, no longer the twilight haze. The barbarian horde wasn’t to be seen, nor was—that other. Whatever it was Janus had glimpsed.
Janus groaned a little and sat up, rubbing his head. They questioned him eagerly
“Maybe I didn’t see it,” he muttered. “You wouldn’t believe me anyway. Gravity’s normal, so let’s get out of here.”
And when they pressed their questions, he only shook his head stubbornly.
Heedless of their aching muscles, they zipped out of the bulging suits. Mark’s hand went instantly to an inside pocket near his heart, where he’d placed his secret flat box with the lenses. He was relieved to find that it, at least, was undamaged.
JANUS was breaking out the weapons.
He handed each of them an atomic rifle and neutro pistol. Brownell had taken a sample of the atmosphere and announced it was fit for them. They debarked onto a plain where lush yellow grass sprang waist high.
“Strange,” Brownell was muttering. He stared back the way they had come. Only a few yards behind them was the twilight zone! It was sharply defined, gray and misty, reaching sheerly up. Yet they stood in bluish daylight which extended ahead of them to the sharp, downward curve of the horizon.
Brownell walked slowly back to the twilight zone, gingerly testing the gravity. He entered the zone—and fell flat to the ground! Janus leaped to him, dragged him back.
“Did you ever see such a thing?” Brownell exclaimed as he rose. “Not only i9 there a sharp division of light and dark, but half the planet is terrifically heavy while the other half is normal. It defies all laws as we have known them.” Janus was peering intently into that grayness—toward the edge of the forest a hundred yards away.	Suddenly he
gripped the Professor’s arm. His voice came a little hysterically.
“I wasn’t dreaming, then. I see it! There it is—the thing that grabbed our ship! Don’t move, you men, because I swear—it’s watching us!”
Gradually they made it out, as they stared in the direction of Janus’ gaze. It was a huge bulking shape that towered above the tallest trees. A roughly round, metallic body that rested on four jointed metal legs. Metal arms, too, dangled at its side.
“A robot!” came in a whisper from Dethman’s lips. “A metal robot, but good Lord—look at the size of it!”
They were looking. Fifty feet above the ground they could make out its head, semi-spherical—and there were two eyes glowing with a greenish light, eyes that must have been large as dinner plates! It stood quite motionless in the gloom near the forest, watching them.
“That’s the thing that towed us here?” Brownell whispered.
“Yes! I just got a bare glimpse of it.” “Must be friendly, then. But I wouldn’t want to shake hands with it! The thing does seem to be watching us, doesn’t it?” “I’ll fix it!” Ferris suddenly brought his rifle up, took aim at the glowing eyes.
Janus whirled, knocked the rifle aside. “You fool! That’s an intelligent entity, I tell you! Want to get us killed?”
As though it had seen and comprehended the action, the robot’s eyes blinked once or twice. It was eerie. Then it raised one of its arms and seemed to gesture—not at them, but beyond them. With that, it turned and stalked away, crashing through the forest.
“I get it,” Mark said thoughtfully. “It was warning us to stay on our side of the fence!”
“And that’s just what we will do. It’s the only place where we can stand up, much less move about.”
They walked back to the prow of the ship. “Where does this daylight come from?” Brownell was still puzzled. “There’s no sun. Seems to me this gravity has something to do with it, too. Say! Do you suppose this light—”
He never finished, for at that moment they heard a shout ahead of them, and saw a group of men approaching. They were tall and straight, clean shaven, and dressed in trousers and tunics of rough texture but undoubtedly of Earth pattern —the pattern which had been popular hundreds of years ago! They carried weapons too, the old-type electric rifles which were so devastating at close range but not very effective at longer distances.
They came warily at first, but smiled when they saw the newcomers were not going to cause trouble.
“Greetings!” their leader said in perfect English. “You’re from Earth? We thought we saw your ship crash, and came over to investigate.”
Janus stepped forward and introduced himself, shook hands.
“My name is Donli,” the other said. He pronounced it that way, crisply, running the syllables together. Mark suddenly wondered if this could be a contraction of “Donnolly”.
DONLI and his men were speechless for a moment, staring in turn at the spaceship, the new-type weapons, and Ral Kaar j.
“You have never seen a Martian before ?” Kaarj grinned at them in a friendly manner.
“Pardon our staring,” Donli replied. “We have never seen a Martian, nor such a spaceship as this, nor any other world We have waited long for this! Long!”
“You’ve seen no other world. But you are Earthmen.”
“We have been here always.”
“I begin to understand,” Brownell said. “There are others of you here? Where do you stay?”
“Our city is only fifty miles from here. We shall be happy if you accompany us there. We have good roads, and surface cars. Our leader, Mari, will explain everything to you.” Donli paused, glancing nervously into the twilight strip. “You should be of great help to us against the Perlacs, with your new weapons.”
“Perlacs? Are those the furry creatures with the lights on their heads?”
“Yes. We call them that because Perlac is the name they give to the world. They have warred on us for generations. We number a mere five hundred, and they are thousands.” Donli looked worried. “And now that the robots are active again, we are in even more danger.”
“We saw one of those metal giants,” Janus exclaimed, “just a few minutes ago!”
“Yes, we saw it too. We came up just as it was stalking away. It’s the first we’ve ever seen, but we have heard much about them; the stories have been handed down. There is supposed to be a great temple on the dark side, where the robots are housed.”
“More of them?” Mark exclaimed. “I hope they stay over there, then!”
Donli shook his head. “This I know: if the robots are roaming again, as they did many years ago, none of us will be safe.”
“Then let us go to your city,” Brownell put in. “We should be able to lift gravs now, if the Tuner hasn’t been damaged.”
It hadn’t been. In a few minutes they were winging low across the plains to the horizon.
The city bore the unusual name of “Frell”, and lay semi-circularly at the foot of a sharply rising hill. People were seen, men and women alike, working in the surrounding fields.
Donli led them through the main street. The buildings were of a dark substance that might have been earth compressed to concrete hardness. They entered the most imposing of these buildings, and thence to a huge room which was almost
the size of a theater on Earth.
“Make yourselves at ease,” Donli said, “while I summon Mari. She will probably be at the laboratories now.”
“Mari,” Driscoll said, when Donli had gone. “So their leader is a woman! And they have laboratories!”
They gazed about them. The curious daylight came through windows of glass or similar material. There were chairs and tables of finely-wrought metal. Along one wall were bookcases filled with charts and uniquely-bound volumes. There were other volumes too, which seemed vaguely familiar.
Brownell walked over there.
“Look at this! A whole case full of books from Earth—scientific, technical books, all of them!” He read a few of the titles on the faded bindings. “These were all popular hundreds of years ago. And these others,” he waved, “are probably the entire recorded history of these people. I’d give anything to look into them.” He didn’t touch the volumes, but remained thoughtful.
Mark too was thoughtful. “Frell,” he mused. “A strange name for this city. Seems as though it ought to mean something, but I can’t quite place it.”
DONLI returned soon, accompanied by Mari. She was tall, lithesome, her features classical and still beautiful despite smudges of sweat and grime from the laboratory. Her golden hair was braided into a halo which gave a queenly appearance, and her eyes were bluer than the strange daylight of this world. Skirt and tight-fitting bodice were of rough texture but dyed a rich golden color.
Involuntarily the men gasped, but Mari did not mind that or their stares. She seated herself and bade them be seated opposite her. Then she leaned forward, searching their faces. Not until then did they notice that her eyes were cold, suspicious.
“You have come from Earth, of course. And Donli tells me this strange one is Martian. Who is leader among you?”
“Why, I suppose I am,” Janus said. “Either me or Professor Brownell, here.” “Professor?” Her mind seemed to grope for the meaning. “Ah! That word means a man of scientific learning, does it not?”
“In this case, yes,” he answered.
Brownell spoke softly. “Madam, we come in peace. We want to be friends and we want to help you, if we may. You need have no suspicion of us.”
“No suspicion? You come from the dark side! From the Perlacs!” She spat the last word venomously.
Donli, standing there, seemed troubled. He said:
“We only found them near the twilight zone. They were most friendly in manner and speech! They seem—”
Mari waved a hand, and he was silent. She said:
“Men of Earth, you wonder why I am suspicious? Know, then, that we observed your ship five days ago, crossing our land with tremendous speed and heading for the dark side! Why have you waited until now to come here? It could be that you have allied yourselves with the Perlacs! Have they sent you here?”
There was a moment of stupefied silence. They could scarcely believe that she was serious, but her cold manner assured them of it. Then the answer must have dawned on all of them at once.
“Ketrik!” Janus boomed, hoisting his big frame from the chair. “By all that's holy, he did reach here! She must have seen Ketrik’s ship!" Then he sobered. “But—if it was streaking for the dark side, it was surely out of control. Ketrik must be dead by now. To think I'd live to see the day when that man blanked out.”
Mari had drawn a strange looking pistol from a belt at her waist. She gestured with it now and said:
“Be seated, please. We will talk yet a while. This Ketrik—he is another one from Earth?”
“Yes, he came before us. Came alone. We only landed here today, a few hours ago! Believe me, we want no part of those Perlacs. We had a little trouble with them.”
She seemed relieved, and satisfied at last. “Forgive my suspicion of you. But where the safety of my people is concerned, 1 cannot be too careful. We have had trouble with the Perlacs, always. The greatest trouble is yet to come and it is brewing fast.” She appeared to be mar-

shading her thoughts, then she went on: “We are the seventh generation of a party of Earth people who arrived here hundreds of years ago. My direct ancestor, Wilm Frell, was leader of that expedition. Our city is named in his honor!” “I’ve got it!" Mark exclaimed. “She means William Farrell! The Farrell expedition was one of the earliest and most ambitious interstellar attempts. Men had already reached the moon and were trying for Mars. Farrell set out with a hundred men and women aboard—”
“A hundred and forty,” Mari corrected. “We have his log here. They missed Mars, their compasses were wrecked in the asteroids and they continued outward for months, finally crashing here. We still do not know what planet this is!”
“You’re beyond Pluto!” Brownell told her. “But how could they have survived a crash on this heavy world ?”
“It is one of the miracles. The records tell of it. They landed near the light! The light at that time encompassed a very small area, only a few miles. Gravity there was normal, but beyond, it was very heavy. They investigated the center of light and found the Stone.”
BROWNELL was excited. “I suspected something like this! The Stone? What is it?”
“We still do not know, except that it supplies us with light and normal gravity and a temperate zone very favorable to our crops. It defies our science, and it certainly must have come from somewhere far beyond our solar system! Our ancestors found it deeply buried and dug it out. The moment they did—”
“Yes ?”
“The light from it spread slowly, very slowly. In about ten years’ time it had encompassed this entire hemisphere, stopped only by the sharp curvature of the planet.” “And as the light spread outward, the heavy gravity vanished?”
“That is true. We have the Stone now atop our hill, which is the highest spot. Our ancestors, however, had to fight for it time and again. The Perlacs at that time were really savages. They had known of the buried light but were afraid to approach it. Later they tried to get the Stone, but were always driven back into the darkness. They have warred on us ever since—for generations!
“In the last few years they have become very strong. They are using explosives now. I believe that ages ago, long before the first Earthmen came, a civilization existed and died here. The present Perlacs must have discovered remnants of an ancient science, and are slowly reviving it!”
There was a moment of silence. Janus took advantage of it to hand his atomic rifle to the girl, and his neutro-pistol as well.
“Have you ever seen weapons like these ?”
She examined them excitedly, especially the neutro pistol. “Donli, look at this!” she pointed at the firing coils. “It seems to be the same principle we're working on!”
“Do you mean to say you’re trying to invent a neutro gun?” Janus was amazed.
“Yes,” Donli answered. “We’ve been working on it for the past several years, but it’s been slow and hard. Sometimes disastrous.” He stepped to a bookcase, brought out one of the ancient volumes. It was Spurlin’s Evolution and Control of the Free Electron.
“We’ve worked from the principles set forth here,” Donli explained, “and with some slight measure of success. But we feel that we’re treading on dangerous ground. Only a few months ago one of our laboratories was blown up and four men killed.”
Brownell nodded. “Even when Spurlin wrote that book there was no real control of the electron. It came later. Anyway, we can help you now! We have the real models here to work from. Would you like to see these guns in operation?”
It was a needless question. They repaired outside, where Janus demonstrated the atomic rifle first, aiming at a harmless clump of bushes some fifty yards away. The atomic pellet struck and exploded, leaving a miniature crater.
“That,” Brownell said, “is an example of uncontrolled atomic explosion. Rather crude, but it serves its purpose. Now let us observe a refinement of it. Controlled, electronic action ”
Janus aimed the pistol. A bluish, pencil-thin ray leaped forth. Where it touched, substance vanished into a froth of flame. The ground itself became incandescent glass. The ray remained constant so long as his finger touched the firing stud.
Mari was excited. “Then you will help us perfect ours? The Perlacs are becoming stronger than we have ever known them, and whenever they start scouting the twilight zone, it means trouble. Donli tells me the robots are active again, too!”
“We can and will help you,” Brownell assured her. “I doubt if those overgrown robots will stand up long under an electronic ray!”
The Professor was eager to see the Stone, and Mari graciously accompanied him to the crest of the hill where it was housed. The others, meanwhile, went with Donli on a tour of the shops and laboratories.

BROWNELL told them later, in great excitement: “I swear to you, it defies all physical laws as we know them! It’s merely a shiny chunk of rock, a few yards in diameter—but do you know, I believe it actually feeds upon gravity! I have always believed that gravity, magnetism, and other such universal forces are all a part of the electrical spectrum. Some peculiarity in the atomic structure of this Stone draws the straight-line force of gravity to it, and that force is then oscillated, transmitted into light! The process is unending!”
“That’s all very well,” Mark told him, “but I believe the greatest miracle is right here in the laboratories. These people have had to utilize the barest elements of this world, but they’ve done wonders. They have plastiglass, and farm implements, and electrical power—even crude atomic furnaces.”
“They’d have their neutro-pistols right now,” Janus agreed, “but they hit the same stumbling block that baffled our scientists for so long.”
For days they worked ceaselessly on the neutro-pistols. Mark and the Professor together laid out the blueprints, devising a radical and more potent design for the firing coils. The latter was surprised at
Mark’s knowledge of electronic principles.
“I may surprise you even further, one of these days/’ Mark promised.
And now the urgency of their work was really impressed upon them. Scouts returning each day from the twilight zone reported that the Perlacs were gathering. Thousands of them swarmed the forests on the dark side, apparently massing for an all-out attack. There had been a few preliminary skirmishes but nothing serious as yet.
Donli undertook the task of setting up barricades at the twilight border. These were huge shields of light but durable metal, arranged in strategic positions, easily movable. And the work at the city went on apace.
Janus and the others directed work at the forges and metal shops. Everyone, men and women alike, who could be spared from the border defenses, were given assignments. Mari was a surprise to the new men. Already she knew the ancient science textbooks by heart, and she thirsted for more knowledge. She was everywhere, directing, helping, learning. She grasped the principle almost at once when Brownell explained:
“Briefly, the atom itself must not be shattered. That has been your mistake. Successive sheathes of electrons must be stripped without disruption of the ultimate atomic structure. That means swift transmutations, not disintegration. Most important of all, the electrons must be propelled along a controlled, directional beam.,,
Only Ferris was dissatisfied at the hard work. In their quarters, at the end of the first week, he complained:
“What's all this getting us? I thought we came out here to make a fortune! That's the story you gave me, Janus, when you rooked me into this deal."
Janus looked at him distastefully. “Haven't you ever wanted to do a decent act in your life? Lord knows I've done some scandalous things, but these people need our help now and they deserve it!"
“That's not getting back the fortune I . sunk into this venture," Ferris grumbled.
“We'll think of that later."
The work was slower than they wished, for it became apparent the Perlac attack was going to materialize any day, any hour. As leader of the defense, the all-
out call was left to Donli, who, with his select group, remained at the border constantly now.
And on the tenth day, even before the new pistols had been assembled or tested —the call came. One of the scouts raced into the city with the signal.
EVERYONE, men and women alike, left their work instantly. Dozens of the electrically-motored surface cars were waiting, and soon they were racing along the road. Within the hour they had reached the twilight zone to reinforce Donli’s group.
Each person was equipped with an electric rifle which, at the longer distances, stunned but was not fatal. And there were quantities of atomic grenades. The new Earthmen retained their atomic rifles and neutro-pistols, as they better understood the operation of these weapons and could use them to more advantage.
The attack had not yet come but Donli was expecting it at any minute. Each group took up its assigned position behind a barrier. Mark found himself beside Janus and was glad, for he liked that blustering, red-bearded giant.
“It's going to be hell," Janus promised, peering into the twilight gloom. “We have to wait for them. The Perlacs can come over into our lighter gravity, but their gravity'd be fatal to us!"
Mark nodded. “It means we’ll be fighting a strictly defensive battle."
The twilight beyond faded into the darkness of the huge forest, and not a Perlac was to be seen. Not so much as a moving shadow. But they were there, Mark knew, thousands of them; and when they came it would be silently.
And silently they came. Mark’s first intimation was the explosion of grenades far down the line, and then he saw them —hordes of Perlacs, heavy of limb, but coming with amazing speed. Most of them were using cross-bows, and Mark realized that some of the shafts were equipped with metal-tipped explosives. Then he was too busy for further obesrvation, as he brought his atomic rifle to bear.
The old style electrics were at work too, all along the line; and the grenades blasted huge gaps in the advancing tide. But still they came, moving now across the lighter
zone. Thousands hadn’t been an overstatement! The dark tide came rushing over their stunned and dead.
And now those explosive tipped shafts w’ere having effect. Several of them struck a barricade next to Mark, and tore the metal from the foundations. Now Janus, beside him, was bringing the neu-tro-pistol into play.
Savagely Mark swung his beam in a never-ceasing arc, exulting at the swath it cut before him. Further down, Driscoll, Kaarj and the others were doing the same. Together with the grenades it seemed to stem the tide, but only for a moment.
“Keep it going! Keep it going!” Janus was yelling. “These beams are good for hours !’*
The very silence of the attack made it the more terrible. No yells, no screams of fury came from the heavy-furred Per-lacs as they littered the terrain by the score.
Then, as suddenly as they had come, they retreated. The seven sweeping beams had done the work well, but in an unexpected manner. Flames were leaping in the lush grass between the defenders and the forest!
“Respite!” Janus yelled. “Ten minutes, maybe. They’ll be back when that grass is burned down!”
But there was no resting now. A score of men were dead and twice that many wounded, who had to be carried back from the battle line. Three of the barricades were wrecked, and they strove to get these into place again.
Mark noticed Mari, sweat-grimed and weary, her golden hair streaming down. But she was magnificent still, a tower of strength as she hurried along the line giving aid and encouragement to her people.
“I wonder where the robots are?” Mark suddenly remembered as he worked beside Janus. “If the Perlacs have learned to reactivate those monsters, as Donli thinks—”
“Encouraging, ain’t you? As if we’re not having a hard enough time as it is!”
And then Mark remembered something else. Remembered so suddenly that he began laughing, a little wildly, and Janus slipped him a light one on the jaw.
“Come out of it, lad! None of that, now—we're not licked yet!”
But Mark had reached to his inner
pocket, and brought out his secret flat box. “Remember this, Janus? Good Lord, but I ought to be blasted for forgetting it! You always knew it wasn’t a camera— well, now you’re going to see it in action!” “Good, lad! I hope you’ve got something there. Here they come again!”
THIS time the Perlacs had massed their forces, and they came in two wide flanking movements aimed at the ends of the barricades.
“Let them get close,” Janus passed the word to the men, as they hurried down to the left. “Then give them your grenades —all you’ve got!”
Grim-faced they waited. Mark once more touched the release stud on his box, exulted as the coils hummed into power.
“Now!” Janus yelled at last, and swept his beam into play. Simultaneously the grenades rained outward. The terrain erupted in geysers of blackened grass and fleshy fragments. But determinedly the Perlacs came, and their cross-bow shafts filled the air.
Despair began to touch the Earthmen now. It was obvious the fanatical Perlacs were going to make this a war to extinction, and there could be but one final re-suit. The Perlacs outnumbered them a hundred to one. If only they could have gotten the new electronic weapons ready in time! Even their grenades were running low now.
Grim-lipped, Mark waited for the next onrush. He passed his neutro to a neighbor and concentrated on his box. Its power had been proven in minor tests, but this would be the maximum!
The wave came. More of them now than before. Mark stepped for a moment into the open, heedless of the shafts. The box, held waist high, looked for all the world like a camera. . . .
But the result was devastatingly different!
The men felt a violent holocaust of air around them, rushing away from all sides. For seconds they couldn’t breathe or move! The temperature dropped so suddenly that they were literally frozen where they stood! Then warmer air came pressing in again but still they didn’t move, because now they were staring—staring at the miracle.
In a hundred-yard area before their barricade the mass of Perlacs were motionless, many of them arrested in grotesque postures! Others had literally burst outward. But all were dead, and now they began to topple over, like frozen statutes!
Another wave was coming behind, just beyond the area. Now they wheeled and fled for the forest. Quickly Mark adjusted the sights and gave them another burst. The same thing happened. The rush of air, the sudden drop in temperature—and the horde was a mass of frozen corpses. But this time, the box became hot in Mark’s hands, burning them severely, and he quickly dropped it.
At the other end of the line the defenders weren’t doing so well. The Perlacs had gained that end of the barricade, and the battle was furious and to the death.
"Come on!” Mark raced for that end, followed by the others. But now Mark couldn’t use his weapon, for it would mean blasting Earthmen and Perlacs alike!
And then, fantastically, the battle seemed to hang poised.
There came a grinding, shuddering sound. A series of these sounds. The ground seemed to vibrate, and then along the twilight strip came a towering, stalking, fifty-foot shape. One of the robots! It came swiftly, purposefully, huge eyes glaring down—straight for the battle line!
V
tf'TVHIS does it,” Janus groaned. “That A thing looks mad!” But no other robots came, and he raised his beam-pistol in readiness as the great monster came bearing down.
“Hold it,” Mark caught his wrist. “Hold your fire, men!”
For the Perlacs were fleeing! Forgotten now was the fury of battle as they raced en masse back to the darkness of their forest!
And abruptly the robot swerved in its course, went after them with purposeful strides. It bent down a little and swept huge, claw-like hands close to the ground. A few of the Perlacs were caught, dashed to the ground, never to rise. Almost gleefully the metal monster trampled down the edges of the forest. The Earth people could
only watch wearily, numbly. It was over. Unbelievably, the battle was over.
Tiring at last of its mad sport, the robot turned and came striding back. Heedless of Mark’s warning, Mari stepped forth and faced it defiantly, rifle held in readiness. Tall and straight, her golden hair tumbling down, she was a defender of her people to the last.
And the robot paused! Only for a second, during which it seemed to be surveying her. Then it came on, but stopped some twenty yards away.
Then it spoke! The voice was rasping, metallic, but the words were unmistakable:
“Hi-ya, bud. What’s cookin’?”
Janus’ voice was a ridiculous gurgle in his throat. He took a step backward and his eyes bulged. For the thing had seemed to be addressing him!
At last he got the words out: “Ketrik! By all the red-tailed Zigs on Venus, it’s Ketrik! Only he could use an archaic expression like that—what’s cookin’,, indeed !”
There came a rumble of metallic laughter.
“Hi-ya, Janus! Haven’t seen you in years. And Kaarj! Last time I saw you was on Deimas, when I robbed the temple of ancients. How are you, kid?” The robot went down, extended a long metal finger as big around as a man’s arm. Kaarj retreated hastily!
“Well, ain’t any of you glad to see me?” the voice came mockingly. “And after I saved your battle, too!”
“Sure, we’re glad to see you,” Janus replied shakily. “But good Lord, man, come down out of that thing so we can get a look at you!”
“Hell, no. I’m havin’ fun! Anyway, I’m not up here. Not the real Ketrik. My body’s lying in an alcove back there at the temple of robots.”
Mari had come to stand beside Janus. Her face was flushed from the recent battle, but some of her defiance had fled. The robot bent closer still, seemed to be peering. Then came a long whistle, metallic but shrill, and one of the huge eyes winked!
The girl seemed to recognize that primitive sound and her face turned a deeper red. But she stepped a pace forward.
“Mister—ah—Ketrik, you have saved my people and have earned our undying thanks! But what about the Perlacs—do
you think they'll be coming back again ?”
The robot chuckled. “Not for a long time! Certainly not when they know Fm around. Those babies have given me a wide berth so far.” He added: “I’ve been intending to pay a visit to your side of the world, but I could tell those dark-skinned brutes were up to something. I decided to hang around and await developments.” “But Ketrik”—Janus hesitated—“what's this about your body?”
“Don’t worry, it’s safe. This is only the mental part of me. Sure, there’s a huge temple about ten miles back, with dozens more of these robots standing around idle.” A sudden thought occurred. “Want to take a look? I could carry you across the heavy gravity.”
“No thanks!” Janus declined. “My scientific interest doesn’t go that far. Maybe the Professor, here—”
“Sure!” Brownell came forward, eager.
“I’ll go too,” Mark said. “I’d like to see how those robots work.”
Ketrik extended a huge hand. Brownell and Mark clung tightly as it swung them up. With the two men perched on its shoulders, the robot went striding back through the forest.
The temple, massive and pillared, rested in a wide clearing.
They saw the robots, dozens of them lining the walls. The quartz discs of their eyes were now dull and lifeless. And near each robot, fifty feet high in the wall, were alcoves.
“Gravity here is normal!” Mark noticed suddenly.
“Yes,” Ketrik replied. “That’s probably what saved my life. I crashed right through the roof!”
They saw Ketrik’s spacer on the floor below them, its nose and forward tubes crumpled beyond recognition.
“I’ll show you my body.” He strode to one of the alcoves, and the men stepped from his shoulders onto a stone ledge. Before them was a thick glass coffin. Resting in it was the material Ketrik!
IT was a large body, as large as Janus, but clean shaven. The blue eyes were open and staring, and even in this suspended state there seemed to be a quality of recklessness, even amusement, about them.
“How do you get the mental self into the robot?” Brownell asked.
“Damned if I know how it works,” there was almost a shrug in Ketrik’s robot voice. “I just experimented with the thing.”
He just experimented! Mark marvelled at this man.
“Don’t touch it,” Ketrik warned, “but you’ll notice there are two cathodes attached to the temples of my earth body. See how the wires lead out, and up to that panelled board on the wall? There are all kinds of coils and things behind that board. Those other cathodes, that you see dangling, were attached to the brain plate of the robot. I suppose the molecules of your mental self flow through the wires. When the transference is complete, you merely detach the cathodes and start walking about, a full-fledged robot! I tell you it’s wonderful!”
“Ketrik,” Brownell said, as they went back through the forest, “we should be returning to Earth as soon as we complete the new weapon for Man’s people. Don’t you want to return with us?”
“No, I think I’ll stay. I want to be sure those Perlacs don’t cause any more trouble for a while.”
“There wouldn’t be any other reason?” Mark grinned.
“There would and is.” The smile was in Ketrik’s voice, if not on his metal lips. “I like that golden - haired Amazon — what’s her name—Mari?”
“But why return at all?” Mari wanted to know, when the Professor announced the plans. “You have said you wanted a base for the manufacture of your Frequency Tuners. What better place than here ?”
“Thank you, my dear. I had thought of that, but after all this is your world, and we are intruders.”
Mari was hurt. “After all that you’ve done for us? And you can do so much more!”
“Then rest assured we’ll be back, possibly within a month. True, there is much to be done here but we need new supplies, tools, equipment of every sort.”
Janus said: “And with your permission, we’ll want to bring back some new men. Not rogues and adventures like me, but scientific men who can come here and
work out their ideas without fear of that stupid Earth Bureau. Men like Mark, here, and the Professor.”
Brownell nodded agreement. “I see a • new regime. The Tri-Planet Council will have to cooperate with expanding endeavors, or take a back seat. Already I know two men on Earth, and four on Mars, who’ll be delighted to come here to carry on their work. And Mark, that reminds me. That new weapon of yours.
I think we can ask about it now?”
“Oh, it’s nothing much, but I wasn’t going to let the Bureau have it on their terms! It’s merely an advanced frigidation idea. Works along an extended magnetic beam, absorbing all heat in a given area, almost to absolute zero.”
“And he says it’s nothing much!” came from Janus.
“It still needs some working out. The coils didn’t stand up, the last time I applied it out there.”
In two more days they were turning out the neutro weapons in quantity. During that time nothing more was seen of the Perlacs, as the robot-Ketrik maintained a vigilance. Brownell made a last check-up of the spaceship, and more important still, he strengthened the Frequency Tuner to counteract the gravity.
ON the last night, Mark tossed restlessly in his bed. He could not sleep, and he didn’t know why. Was it something they had forgotten? He didn’t think so. Nevertheless he had a preternatural awareness of something wrong. . . .
He arose, dressed quickly. There was never “night” on this side of the little world, but the rooms were automatically dimmed. Silently he tip-toed through the rooms. Brownell was there, sleeping peacefully. And Janus, and all the others.
No! Ferris was gone.
Mark’s heart leaped. He had never liked that man, never quite trusted him. Now it came back. Ferris’ eternal harping about the fortune he had put into this expedition.
If that little rat was planning— Mark hurried outside. The city was deathly quiet, immersed in sleep. The eternal light struck his eyes and brought him fully alert. He hurried along the street toward the outskirts, toward the base of the hill where the spaceship waited.
As he neared the hill, he spied Ferris. The man was coming down the slope. Ferris saw him, and waved a hand in greeting.
“Hi! Is it you, Travers? What’s the matter, can’t you sleep either?”
Mark’s steps slowed, and he breathed in relief. He’d been wrong. After all, the man had a right to be up.
They met near the spaceship, and Ferris waved a hand toward the crest of the hill. “I was just looking at the Stone. It’s the damnedest thing!”
“Yes. Brownell tells me—”
Ferris’ hand moved like lightning. Mark found himself staring into the stub end of a neutro-gun. Ferris was no longer smiling and casual.
“In!” he snarled.“Get in there—quick!” He gestured toward the ship, and Mark noticed the door was open. He moved toward it slowly, then paused, started to turn.
“I’ll blast you, Travers!”
Mark shrugged, entered. Ferris came quickly behind him.
“That’s better. I don’t want to rouse any of the others. Sounds carry far on this world.” He paused and grinned, with all but his eyes. “Sure, Travers, I was looking at the Stone. I’d like to get it back to Earth, but it’s too much for me. Guess I’ll just have to be satisfied with the Frequency Tuner. The Bureau of Inventions will pay me a handsome price for it, no questions asked.”
“You sneaking, double-crossing rat,” Mark said slowly. “You’ll never get away with this!”
“This says I will,” Ferris sneered, gesturing with the neutro. “And since you came snooping out here, I’ll just take that new weapon of yours.”
“It doesn’t work any more.”
“I’ll take it anyway. Hand it over. Careful!”
Mark shrugged, tossed the box-like weapon to him. But his mind was racing. Ferris had the upper hand, all right, and he would get away with this if Mark didn’t do something quick. Mark glanced around. They were in the control room, and he knew the Frequency Tuner was ready. He said:
“What about	Brownell—Janus—the
others ?”
“What about ’em ? They wanted to come out here, so let ’em stay. Yeah—for the next hundred years!”
“What about me?”
“You know, I think I’ll just take you along—for a short distance, anyway.” Mark’s voice was taunting. “Because you’re not quite sure how to handle this Frequency control. You’ll need me.” “And that’s where you’re wrong. I’ve studied it plenty. It’s easy!”
Mark dropped suddenly to his knees, and with the same movement his body lashed forward—low and hard. He heard the neutro sing, and felt the swirling heat of it over his shoulder. But Ferris was quick. He danced lithely back. His right hand with the gun in it came swinging up.
The heavy gun caught Mark squarely under the chin.
HE came struggling back to consciousness, aware that he was still lying prone. He allowed his brain to clear before opening his eyes, but already he could tell they were in space.
He thought of his friends on Perlac— stranded! It would be a mircle if they ever succeeded in building another spaceship there, with their limited equipment.
“Hi, Travers. We’re on our way. So I can’t handle the Tuner, eh?”
Mark groaned, rolled his head a little, feigning grogginess. But he was alert now, and he cursed himself for a fool for underestimating Ferris. He heard the man’s voice go on:
“And to show how much I need you, I’ll just toss you out somewhere between Perlac and Pluto. Or maybe between Pluto and Neptune. Which would you prefer ?”
Mark’s heart leaped. They couldn’t have come far, then! He was lying near the control-console and he knew they were on robot control. Ferris must have set the course already. He was confident now, watching Mark, for he knew it took minutes to adjust that complex set-up.
Mark stirred, grasped a metal stanchion to help hoist himself erect. His plan was made. To the right of the console was an auxiliary unit, feeding emergency power to the Tuner. He wondered if Ferris knew of it. He glimpsed Ferris coming toward him. Mark surged erect, his right hand darted out. It came down in a full sweep
against the auxiliary impellator.
The spacer leaped ahead, sickeningly, as acceleration multiplied in a split second. Mark glimpsed Ferris flying backward. He hadn't time to see more. Both hands gripped the stanchion now as intolerable pressure built up. His arms seemed to be wrenching from their sockets. Slowly, agonizingly, he managed to encircle the stanchion with his left arm. His right hand seemed to weigh a ton as it reached out. It touched the impellator stud . . . reversed it.
Mark sagged limply forward as acceleration lowered. He hadn’t the strength left to turn his head, see what had happened to Ferris.
When he did, minutes later, he saw a limp figure against the far wall. The limbs were twisted beyond recognition. The head was crushed. It wasn’t a pretty sight.
Mark changed direction, headed in a sweeping parabola back toward Perlac. He avoided Brownell’s previous mistake and swung wide of the planet, approaching it from the light side. He landed safely near the city. The others had already missed the ship, and they received him joyously.
They left the next day, after a final check-up. Mari had prepared long lists of items for them to bring back to her people.
The robot-Ketrik was there too, to bid them bon voyage. Brownell said:
“Ketrik, you can reclaim that body of yours. Sure you won’t change your mind and go back with us?”
Again Ketrik resorted to archaic expression :
“Are you kidding?” and he glanced at Mari with his huge robot eyes.
They lifted gravs, and not until they were crossing the orbit of Pluto did Brownell remember something. He chuckled, said to Mark:
“Suppose Ketrik does transfer again to his body, as he probably will. How’s he going to transport it across that heavy gravity ?”
For a moment Mark was startled. Then he grinned and replied, “Well, don’t worry your mind over that. I’ll bet you a thousand to one he’ll do it I Positively. That man will find a way!”

Leah Barrow would die. Tar Norn had sworn she would, unless he was set free. But freedom for the Venusian Pirate meant death for many, and it was Director Barrow’s duty to hold him
though it would cost his daughter’s life.
MART WELLS shut off the alarm
buzzer and jumped out of bed— much to his regret. He cussed and then grinned sheepishly as he brought up with a thud against the fortunately unbreakable glass of the window. A year on Callisto, and he could still forget that he weighed only thirty-six pounds and couldn’t take a normal step without neutronium-weighted shoes.
Regaining his balance, he yawned and looked out over the rough Callisto landscape beyond Comprotown. Then he yawned again and reached for his uniform.
A year before, Comprotown—and his job as rocketport dispatcher—had been Romance with a capital R. Now, he thought gloomily, Romance with Leah with a capital L, and a fat lot of good that did him when Leah Barrow’s father was Old Fish-face himself, Director of Comprotown.
True, Comprotown held fewer than a thousand colonists, but it was the only inhabited spot on bleak Callisto, and its Director was practical czar of a world. Yes, the Director could well afford to look down his long nose at any uniform with fewer than six stars on its right sleeve. But Leah didn’t feel that—
Suddenly, straightening up as he fastened his weighted boot, he looked more intently out of the window. Something that flashed caught his eye out in the barren, warped hills. A gleam of metal where metal shouldn’t have been. And it looked like a small spaceship.
Mart hastily pulled on his other boot and ran down the stairs. A red-headed mechanic from the rocketport was coming out of the building across the way.
Mart called out, ‘‘Red ! Something about a mile back in the hills looks like a spaceship. Has one been reported down ?” “Huh?” The mechanic looked startled. “You sure? No, there hasn’t been a report. Wait, I’ll radio Central Communications.”
He darted back into the building, and emerged a moment later. “No report. They’re-going to send out the autogiro to look at it. Say, Mart, there are only two small spaceships on Callisto. Could it be—”
Mart was already running toward the comer from which he could see the landing field. He stopped so suddenly that the mechanic almost ran into him, and said, “Whew! They’re both there.” Leah Barrow’s trim little spacecruiser was safe in port. So was the Police one-seater scout— but that wasn’t the one Mart had looked for first.
From near the Administration Building a two-place autogiro was rising, silhouetted for a moment between the horns of the reddish crescent of big Jupiter just above the horizon.
As he walked across the field toward headquarters, Mart surveyed the familiar scene. Three squat freighters were up on the racks, their ugly black bottoms over the ash-filled blasting pits; four others were on dollies ready to be serviced.
All seven were ready for their regular weekly Callisto-Jupe hop, ready to pick up more ore. And, as usual, they’d go out today to clear the field for the sleeker, faster, long-haul ships that would arrive from Earth tomorrow for the smelted metal. Mart glanced at his wrist-chronometer. Eight o’clock now; in an hour and a half, Freighter One, right on schedule, would start testing its rocket tubes for the ten o’clock hop. And an hour later, Freighter Two would start to warm up for the eleven o’clock blasting-off. And then the others, every hour on the hour.
At his desk in the Administration Building, Mart picked up the familiar sheaf of clearance papers waiting for his attention, and glanced through them. Initialing them was mere routine; they’d never cleared a minute early or a minute late since he’d been there. Director Barrow saw to that.
The Venutian had carried the drugged girl into the nighu
The door opened. Mart put down the papers and glanced up.
ONE of the workmen from the smelting plant, a tall black-haired fellow wear-• ing tinted glasses, stood looking into the office. Mart didn’t remember ever seeing him before—but with several hundred workmen, you couldn’t remember all of them.
“Director Barrow in?”
Mart glanced up at the wall clock before he answered. “He’ll be here in twenty-one minutes. Sit down and wait if you’re off duty.”
He turned back to the papers and finished initialing them, grinning inwardly at
being able to say that the Director would arrive in twenty-one minutes exactly. It wasn’t everywhere that one could make so accurate a prediction about anyone’s arrival time, but Barrow was something of a chronometer himself.
He tossed the papers toward the back of the desk and threw the switch of the communicator on his desk, leaned forward slightly. “Dispatcher Wells calling Police Autogiro.”
“Autogiro, Captain Wayne,” came the reply. “Go ahead, Mart.”
“I was the one who reported seeing the spaceship, Cap—if it was one. Found it? If not, I can—”
“Thanks, Mart, but we’ve sighted it all
right. We're now circling, looking for a spot to come down. It doesn’t take much, but damned if we can perch on a ridge like a canary. Neither could that space-speedster down there.
“Wrecked? What's it look like?” “Ummm. Offhand one of the singleplace jobs that Venusians bought from Earth before the war. Full armament, too.” “What? You sure, Cap? After the Earth-Venus twenty-two eighty treaty, we reclaimed and destroyed all the armed—” “Yeah, I know,” cut in the Captain's voice. “All but a few that the Venusian renegades—the pirates—got off with before then. Well—we’re going down. Corey's found a place not too far from it where he can set the giro down, or says he can.”
“If that’s a pirate ship, Cap, be careful!” “Don’t worry. We’re armed. And the ship's pretty smashed up. Probably at least kayoed whoever was in it. Well, keep your key open and I’ll call you back. We’re down.”
Mart found the shipment chart and began to check off tonnage. That much he wanted to get out of the way before—but something was gnawing at the back of his mind. It took him a moment to trace what it was. Of course. The workman who was waiting for the Director was wearing tinted glasses.
Tinted glasses on Callisto! It didn't make sense. The sun, half a billion miles away, gives only a twenty-fifth of the light that falls on Earth. Even when that light is augmented by Big Jupe, it isn’t—Yes, it was the first time he’d seen tinted glasses in Comprotown.
Curiously, he turned to glance at the seated workman. But the carrier wave of the desk communicator hummed and he forgot his visitor as Captain Wayne's voice boomed in.
“Dispatcher Wells. Captain Wayne calling Dispatcher—”
“Okay, Cap. Go ahead.”
“We’ve examined the spaceship. No one’s in it, hurt or otherwise. It’s a single seater. A pirate ship all right.”
“You sure? How can you be certain?” “Aside from the fact that it would have no business around here if it wasn’t, the papers are a give-away. There’s a whole sheaf of them. Reports on the Ganymede jewel shipments mostly. And a full set of
data on our own little world, Mart. If there’s a Venusian around, he sure knows his way.”
“Dope on Callisto? What kind?”
“A detailed map of Comprotown, showing every building. A full schedule of freighter hops both ways to Jupe and Earth. Details of shipments. That sort of thing.” “Holy stars! But why should a pirate be interested in ore?”
“Don’t imagine he is. Or in Comprotown, either. I’d say from the papers, it was precautionary information. We don’t keep our operations a secret here. He could have picked it up from any magazine article describing Comprotown in detail.
“But I still don’t see—”
“The Ganymede jewel shipments, Mart. I'd say he was bound for Gany and his ship went blooie while he was scudding past Callisto. He got pulled down here and just barely made a landing he could walk away from. I’m afraid there’ll be trouble.” Mart whistled. “Well, the Director's due now. He’ll want a search organized and—Wait, here he is. Tell it over again, Cap, and you’ll be reporting direct* . . • Listen to this, Director.”
THE tall slender figure of Director Barrow stood impassively beside Mart’s desk and listened to a repetition of Wayne’s report. Not a flicker of expression passed over his gaunt face.
As Wayne finished, the Director asked, “Is he armed? Anything taken from the ship’s equipment, Captain?”
“Looks intact, but he probably has side-arms. All the pirates carry them. One funny thing, Director. The timer robot has been removed from the control panel. What on Callisto would he want with a loose timer ?”
“Report back to headquarters immediately, Captain Wayne,” Director Barrow ordered.
The hum of the carrier wave died and Mart clicked off the set. Then, belatedly, he stood up and saluted. “Anything I can do, sir? Everything’s set for the freighters to clear as usual, so I'm more or less free—” Barrow nodded. “Very good, Wells. You may go to the field and direct a search of the freighters. The Venusian’s first thought will be to get away, and he may already be stowed in one of—”
A dry voice interrupted from behind the Director’s back. “But the Venusian would not do anything so obvious, Director Barrow.”
Mart whirled around. '•‘Barrow turned slowly and with dignity.
It was the tall man dressed in the uniform of a smelting plant worker who had spoken. But he wasn’t dark-haired any more. Still seated, he was smiling at them sardonically as he fanned himself with a black wig he had just removed. The top of his head was as smooth as a billiard ball, and dead white. There was a line of demarcation where the dye he had applied to his face came to an end.
He had removed the tinted glasses too, and the blank-surfaced gray eyeballs showed why they had been worn. Now that the simple disguise of wig and glasses was removed, Mart noted some of the other distinguishing features that marked the Venusian. The general flatness of the face and flat unconvoluted ears. The six-fingered hands that had probably been thrust into the pockets of the stolen uniform.
The Venusian glanced down at the wig and glasses. “Standard equipment,” he explained. “I always carry them in my ship and they’ve come in handy before.”
He rose and bowed mockingly. “My name is Tar Norn, and your supposition that I am a pirate is correct. But I assure you that my visit here is accidental and I have no designs on Comprotown.”
Tar Norn! The most vicious and notorious of the pirates, and the most ruthless killer of them all. Mart hastily jerked open the drawer of his desk and pulled out a hand-blaster. He started the formula: “Under authority of the Interplanetary Council, I arrest you, to be held for trial—”
The sardonic smile did not fade from the pirate’s thin lips. He rose and extended his arms upward. “I am unarmed,” he cut in. “It will help our discussion if you will verify that.”
“—before the Supreme Council on Earth,” Mart finished. Then, glancing side-wise at Director Barrow and seeing him nod, he stepped forward warily. Venusians, he knew, were both fast and tricky. Watching every move, he completed the search. Tar Norn carried no weapons.
Why, Mart wondered, had the pirate walked openly into headquarters and given himself up? Obviously, Tar Norn had
something up his sleeve. But—
Director Barrow spoke coldly, as Mart stepped back, still covering the Venusian with the blaster. “Tar Norn, you speak of ‘our discussion.’ There is nothing to discuss. You will be sent to Earth.”
The pirate’s face became vicious. “I do not think so,” he snapped. “I have taken a hostage. It was quite dark—your tiny Callisto in eclipse of its huge primary— when I was forced down. But darkness means nothing to a Venusian. You Earth-men play a strange game with cardboard rectangles. To use its language, Director Barrow, I have an ace in the hole.”
Tar Norn sat down again and folded his six-fingered hands quite calmly. Light from the ceiling overhead seemed to cast a malignant glow on his dead-white scalp.
“Your daughter, Director,” he continued. “If you wish to see her again, you will give me a ship, your fastest ship.”
THERE was a moment of dead, utter silence. Then Director Barrow leaned over the desk and flicked the key of the communicator. “Control ? Get my—get Leah Barrow at once. Ring her room. If no answer there, get my housekeeper. This is Director Barrow.”
“Your fastest ship,” repeated the Venusian. “Well stocked with supplies. Enough to take me to—to a place in the Asteroid belt. I shall be too late now to carry out my original plans on Ganymede.”
The office door opened and Captain Wayne came in, followed by Roger Corey. Their eyes widened as they saw the Venusian. Wayne’s hand darted toward holster, then relaxed as he 6aw Mart’s blaster trained on the pirate.
He faced Director Barrow and saluted. “Captain,” Barrow ordered, “you will form a search party at once—every available man and means. We must search all of Callisto within—” he made a rapid mental calculation “—about fifty miles. You will be searching for my daughter.”
The captain stiffened. Before he could reply the carrier wave hummed and a feminine voice, that of an elderly woman, came over the communicator. “Director Barrow ? Leah isn’t here. I looked in her room and her bed is disarranged as though she left suddenly. She always makes it herself as soon as she gets up.”
“Anything to point to when she left, Mrs. Andrews?”
“Not exactly, sir. The alarm was set for six and it was still buzzing. Her bed isn't very mussed; it looks like she got up again almost right after she retired. I don't understand.”
Director Barrow's face was bleak. His voice sounded like the drip of water from melting ice. “Clothing?” he asked.
“Her lightweight spacesuit is gone. Apparently she put it on over her sleeping pajamas, for they aren't here. Is there anything I can do, sir? I'm worried; she hasn’t ever—”
“That will be all, Mrs. Andrews,” Bar-row replied. “I'll let you know if there is anything.”
He turned to Captain Wayne. “Use this set, Captain. Get Communications to send out a general alarm and assembly. You can make all necessary arrangements right here.”
Wayne crossed to the communicator, and began to issue rapid instructions.
“Tell them to hurry,” the Venusian cut in mockingly. “They have until nine-thirty o'clock.”
Mart Wells glanced fearfully at the dial of the chronometer. It was eight-forty now. He turned and caught the Director's glance. “The timerl” he said grimly. “Captain Wayne said it was missing from the wrecked ship. He must have—”
The Venusian was grinning. “Exactly. The timer. And a pound of uranite. That gives you fifty minutes to search Callisto. It would be wiser to spend the time getting a ship ready for me instead.”
The silence of the office was broken only by the low voice of Captain Wayne giving orders into the communicator. Abruptly he turned to his superior. His face was white.
“Search is on, sir. But if he isn’t lying, there’s a chance in a million. Less than an hour, and the area to be covered is—”
Barrow was looking straight ahead, and not a muscle of his face moved until he spoke. “I’m afraid he isn’t bluffing. No reason why he should be. Leah is gone and the timer is gone. And a pirate ship would have uranite.”
“The ship?” asked Tar Norn. “It will take some time to fuel it and—”
Director Barrow's voice was positive. “There will be no ship for you, Tar Norn.” Roger Corey's voice cut in, jerkily. “Let me work on him, sir. Me and Wayne. Maybe we can make him talk.”
Barrow shook his head. “No use, Corey. Venusians don't mind pain as much as Earthmen. They almost like it. You could take him apart, and he wouldn't talk.”
The pirate's smile faded. “It will take half an hour to prepare the ship, Director Barrow. Better not stall too long.”
Mart said, his voice urgent. “But, sir, Leah! What's one pirate compared to—” Barrow’s face was granite-like. “He's killed hundreds of people. If we release him, he’ll kill hundreds more. One life cannot weigh against that. Corey, take him away. Lock him up until the next ship leaves for Earth.”
Mart's fists were clenched, his fingernails biting into the palms. But he knew Barrow was right; that he couldn't possibly take any other course and be worthy of his post. One life couldn't weigh against the many lives that meeting the pirate's terms would mean. That was where Tar Norn had miscalculated. A Venusian didn't understand responsibility to society, nor any higher ideal than self-interest.
Tar Norn tossed the wig and glasses to the floor as Corey took his arm. His pupilless eyes seemed to glow with anger.
“You won’t murder your own daughter, Director. This is a bluff. But mine isn't. She dies at nine-thirty unless you find her. I swear that by the Eternal Varga ”
Mart cursed. Fists balled, he lunged toward the Venusian. Barrow put a hand on his arm. “Don’t, Wells. That's up to the Interplanetary Council.”
“But he’s not bluffing,” Mart raved. “Leah will surely die at nine-thirty. That damned oath. Varga. It's the only thing a Venusian is afraid of. He isn’t—” His voice broke.
Corey started off with the Venusian. Barrow said, “Yes, he's telling the truth. But we have some time yet. Maybe the search—”
MART strode to the window and
looked out so the others wouldn't see his face. Less than three-quarters of an hour to search all of Callisto within a radius of fifty miles!
THROUGH the pane he saw figures in groups of three searching the streets and buildings of Comprotown. That part of the search wouldn’t be difficult. But the hills and the caves, and with only two autogiros. If she was there, out of sight in one of the caves, where the cruising ships couldn't see her . . .
Her father was right, but— The picture of Leah Barrow, smiling as he had last seen her, seemed to blur out the view from the window. Her impertinent little tilted nose, the soft tempting contours of her lips, the deep blueness of her eyes.
He whirled from the window and began pacing the floor, trying to think of something they could do that wasn’t being done. Again at the communicator, Captain Wayne was barking questions.
“All available men and women are combing the town, sir,” he reported, “with orders to break down any doors that are locked, to stop at nothing.”
“And outside, Captain?”
“The two giros are our only real hope. But the men from the smelting plant are working afoot out of town. By nine-thirty they’ll have covered a radius of about five miles.”
Corey returned, slamming the door
viciously behind him. “Maybe we could trick him, sir,” he suggested. “Pretend we’ll give him a ship if he’ll—”
“A Venusian wouldn’t trust his own mother,” Barrow snapped. “He’d insist on taking off first and then radioing back where she is. And don’t think he wouldn’t check the fuel tanks.”
“I wish you’d let me and Wayne work on him, anyway.”
Director Barrow didn’t answer.
Mart growled, “If Leah dies, I’m going to take that filthy pirate and—”
Wayne’s voice was bitter. “Venusians can’t help what they are. Blame the Earth council that sold them those ships. If they had used more sense, there wouldn’t be a Venusian off Venus.”
Mart nodded. If the council hadn’t pulled that boner twenty years before, there would be no trouble with the Venus-
•	M
ians.
Venusians were, compared to Earth standards, a strange combination of genius and idiocy. Brilliant mathematicians, they had no mechanical ingenuity whatever.
Linguists who could speak any language fluently after hearing it a few hours, not one of them could create a child’s wind-up toy. Knowing the laws of leverage, they construced their buildings by manual labor alone. Able to operate any machine as long as it was in good working order, they couldn’t as much as figure out how to repair a clogged fuel-line.
Even the pirates based on some of the bigger Asteroids had to depend upon a few renegade Earthmen to keep their ships in running order. And if one went blah away from base, it was a gone ship as far as they were concerned. Probably the trouble that had forced Tar Norn down on Callisto had been a minor matter that any Earth-man could have taken in his stride. But to Tar Norn it meant a new ship or nothing.
The thought of ships reminded him of the freighters. “Cap,” he asked Wayne, “the freighters been searched thoroughly ?”
Wayne nodded. “Rocket tubes and all. Even broke open the ore drums. I presume you’ll want them to clear on schedule?”
Director Barrow nodded. “The crews ?” he asked. “In the search or standing by?”
“Standing by for departure as usual, Director. A few men one way or the other—”
Barrow nodded, glancing at the chronometer. Mart knew what he was thinking. Less than half an hour now. And, unless the searchers by some miracle found Leah Barrow, it would all be over before the ten o’clock clearance of the first freighter. And the freighters hadn’t missed a clearance in ten years.
The carrier wave hummed again. “Central Communications reporting. Most searchers in the town have reported in. No results. Those outside reaching points three miles out.”
The communicator faded. Mart clenched his fists against the futility of that search. Three miles! The strong Venusian, in the light gravity of Callisto, probably had eight or ten hours of darkness to carry his burden. He could easily have covered twenty to forty miles, in any direction. Possibly even more. And the chance of an autogiro—
Obviously, Wayne had been thinking the same thing. “He timed his arrival,” he said bitterly. “He gave us less than an hour. He’d certainly have put her outside

walking range within that length of time. And with all the caves around, thousands of them, would he have put her where a giro could spot anything?”
Mart glanced at Barrow. The Director was sitting as immobile as a statue. His eyes were closed and every muscle of his thin face was tense. Probably he was trying not to look at the chronometer on the wall. It was nine-fifteen.
The office door opened and three uniformed mechanics from the field stood in the doorway. The foremost of them saluted. “This entire building has been searched twice except this office. I presume—”
Director Barrow opened his eyes and stood up “Don’t presume anything. Search here, too.”
The men came in and began a detailed but fruitless search. Nobody spoke until they left.
The chronometer said twenty minutes after nine now. Ten minutes to go, if the timer had been accurately set. But could it have been set wrong? Venusians were lousy mechanics. Maybe—
MART became aware that he was holding his breath for the sound of a distant explosion. Yes, from whatever point Tar Norn could have hidden his hostage, the sound of a pound of uranite exploding would carry back to Comprotown.
He sat down at his desk again. In front of him were the signed clearance papers for the freighters. In half an hour he’d take out the papers for the first freighter. But before that half hour was up—
He twisted a pencil between his fingers, held himself rigid to keep from turning and looking at the chronometer again. It hadn’t been over a minute since he sat down—why torture himself by looking again? But each minute now seemed both a flash and an eternity.
He turned over the sheaf of papers and drew a little square on the blank reverse side of the bottom one. That was Comprotown. He made a dot an inch or two away. That was the point where Tar Norn’s ship had wrecked itself in landing.
He drew a line from the point to the square. That was Tar Norn coming in to
the town. That would have been about ten hours ago.
Then, from the information about Callisto and Comprotown that had been in the papers in Tar Norn’s ship, the pirate had found the home of the director. He would have had no trouble finding Leah’s room. Venusians could see in the dark and walk as silently as cats. He would undoubtedly have drugged Leah into unconsciousness, probably without awakening her, since there had been no sign of a struggle. He’d put her into the lightweight spacesuit.
Why? Undoubtedly it indicated that she would be outdoors. During the Callisto day, it would have been unnecessary. But an unconscious Earthwoman would freeze to death in the cold dark period of Callisto’s eclipse behind Big Jupe.
What then? The Venusian left, carrying her—
He threw down the pencil and began to pace the room again. His muscles were tense from listening. How many minutes ? He didn’t want to know; dared not look.
But Tar Norn must have planned it all before he left the wrecked ship. Otherwise he wouldn’t have taken the timer and—
Would he have rigged the time-bomb first, or after he had kidnapped Leah ? And how? The timer itself would not have provided the concussion to set off the uranite. He’d have needed a battery, a spark-coil, and—
But Venusians weren't mechanics.
They didn’t understand machines, or electricity, or even simple clockworks, brilliant as their strange minds were in other ways.
Tar Norn could have set the timer all right. For that matter, he could calculate an orbit and make settings for space flight. But he couldn’t have made a time-bomb, even with the timer. He couldn’t have rigged a circuit that would set off a cap! And, Mart realized suddenly, the timer itself would be an electrical—not a clockwork—gadget. Once disconnected from the now broken dynamo of the ship, Tar Norn couldn’t have made it run at all!
A momentary surge of elation swept Mart. Tar Norn must have been bluffing! Then he remembered: a Venusian might murder his own family, but he would never swear to an untruth by the Eternal Varga. That one superstition, or religion, as they
looked upon it, was binding beyond all else. And Tar Norn had sworn by that oath that Leah Barrows would die at nine-thirty unless—
Mart looked at the chronometer. It was twenty-six minutes past nine. He caught a glimpse of Director Barrow’s face. It looked like the face of a dead man. Bar-row had obviously given up all hope and waited only for the four minutes to pass.
The carrier wave hummed. All of them started, but the voice from the communicator merely reported, ‘‘All Comprotown reports in. All negative. Giros report nothing. Foot parties five miles out. Reports negative.”
Three minutes to go. Mart could see by the attitude of the others that they were bracing themselves for the sound of an explosion. All of them had liked, or loved, Leah Barrows. Mart had a momentary vision of her again, and remembered the electric thrill that had run through him when she had placed her hand on his arm, just a few days ago, and told him that she did care for him, well, a little anyway—
But, if Tar Norn couldn’t have rigged a time-bomb, how could he have arranged for Leah to die at nine-thirty?
He saw again the corpse-like face of the Director. Yes, they had all been wrong in thinking that nothing mattered to Bar-row more than the schedules—Schedules! There had been departure schedules among the papers in Tar Norn’s ship. Could he have—
With a sudden intake of breath that was almost a gasp, Mart whirled and ran to the communicator. The others looked at him, startled. Mart was yelling at the mike even before he got near enough to it to talk in a normal voice. “Control! Emergency! Get Jupe Freighter One! Tell him not to test his tubes. Not to touch a lever!”
THEN he was racing out of the door and across the field to where the big ugly freighter was up on the racks over the blasting pits. He wasn’t counting on that message through the communicator.
Out of breath, he hammered on the steel door and yanked at the handle until the pilot opened it from within.
7—Planet Stories—Winter
“Hold everything,” Mart yelled at him. “Don’t try the test blasts!”
Whether Mart was right or wrong, there needn’t be any hurry now, but he wa9 already lowering himself into the ash-filled blasting pit under the rocket tubes of the freighter. Carefully, he groped among the ashes from previous blast-offs, ignored the light soft ash that flew up into his face.
A hand touched heavy cloth, and the other found smooth transpariplast, the helmet of a spacesuit. Gently, he lifted the unconscious body of Leah Barrow and handed her up to the men looking down from the rim of the pit.
Ten minutes later, back in the office, Leah was reacting to the antidote Doc Rogers had just administered. A glance at her face had told the medico that the drug had been Venusian tragweed.
Mart was still answering questions.
. . Sure, Tar Norn knew that. Every ship in the system makes its trial blasts just half an hour before take-off. It’s a fixed convention. Rocket captains do everything according to a rigid schedule. And we were looking for a time-bomb so we’d never think of the blasting pits. But Tar Norn couldn’t have rigged a time-bomb. We didn’t think of that when we found the timer was gone. He’d just thrown it away—”
Someone was wringing his hand, and he saw it was Director Barrow. “Mart!” Barrow’s voice wasn’t cold and distant now; all the ice had melted. “I can’t begin to tell you how much— If there is any reward I can possibly offer you—”
Mart Wells grinned.	“—unto your
daughter and half of your kingdom, as they used to say in stories? Well, sir, I don’t know what I’d do with half of Callisto, but as for the other part of it—”
He turned back to the awakening girl. Director Barrow’s answer was cinched, of course, but Leah—? Well, he’d have to ask her again.
But probably she wasn’t up to that just yet, even though her eyes were open now and she was smiling at him. He’d have to give her time, of course, before he asked her. Lots of time. Say, five minutes, or maybe three.

By GARDNER F. FOX
From strange and distant worlds the master beings came to Nee-oonia. bringing with them the science of the Universe. One by one the yfought the alien fire — and died. And now Jonathan Morgan, the Uartnling, whose science was primitive compared to the others,
found himself facing the black flames.
illustrated by DOOLIN
HE STOOD alone in the laboratory,
frightened, staring at the tiny motes of dust that swirled lightly in the breeze. That dust had been a block of solid lead a moment ago; before he had touched it, and concentrated.
Jonathan Morgan licked his lips with a dry tongue. Things like this shouldn't happen to the assistant to the Chief of the National Foundation for Physics Research. It went against every law he had studied so absorbedly for the past twelve years, ever since he had decided in high school to make physics his life work.
“I’m mad," he said to himself, knowing he was utterly sane; that was what frightened, knowing his sanity.
He removed a glass tesx-cube from a wooden rack before him, grasped it firmly and furrowed his brows over his clear black eyes. If this works, he thought savagely, I can chuck every law of physics and organic chemistry into the junk heap, and become a tramp riding the rods of the
first train out of town . . .
The glass in his hands stretched noticeably; grew and expanded to pint size, to the size of a quart container.
“God\”
The glass shattered on the inlaid linoleum floor. Jonathan put out his big hands and clung to the edge of the sandstone tabletop until his muscles bunched in big ridges all along his hairy forearms.
“Dr. Wooden!" he shouted hoarsely. “Dr. Wooden!"
A big man came and stood in the doorway, staring at him, clad in white smock with the sleeves rolled up to bare his wrists.
“Did you call— Jonathan! What's wrong?"
The Chief ran to him, his eyes intent in his white face, his features tense.
“You’ve had a shock. Tell me, did the rays react as we'd hoped?"
“No, no. It isn’t the rays. It's me.
I—I’m infinite!”
Dr. Wooden smiled, saying, “Sit down, boy. You’ve been working too hard. You need a rest. Forget all about the cal-catryte and how to bend the rays it emanates. You need a change. Perhaps the shore. Or my mountain lodge in the Adirondacks."
Jonathan Morgan straightened, shaking his head, muttering, “No, no." His brain was clearing, and he knew with a grim sureness that something big had happened to him, for a reason. He lifted another block of lead, and looked down at it.
“Watch it, Doctor. Watch the lead."
The lead block quivered strangely, undergoing some queer transformation. Its outlines became blurred and vague. It shrank, dissolved; became infinitesimal bits of dust in Morgan’s palm. Jonathan bent and blew on the dust and it fluttered away.
He looked at Doctor Wooden with a wry smile.
“I can do anything, Doctor. I can grow or become small. I can destroy or I can— create!"
“Well," the Chief breathed gustily. “I almost believe you. Whew! Man, do you realize the vast vistas that are opening for you? With power such as that . . . oh, my God! How trite I am after seeing— that!"
“Does sort of stun you," agreed Jonathan dryly. “Doctor, do you think this gift was given to me for a — reason?"
p§i
They knew they had been summoned, that far ahead something demanded their
presence,
99
The Chief glanced sharply at his assistant, then nodded slightly.
“Go on, Jonathan. Tell me what’s on your mind.”
JONATHAN MORGAN stalked up and
down the laboratory aisle, his tall body graceful as the stalking panther, his great shoulders illy fitted in the smeared lab smock. He was a big man. Conference football and baseball had added lithe muscles to the frame that was his heritage from a family of farmers. Black hair, cut crew above a high-cheeked, tanned face, and coal black eyes that were alert as a watching cat, added to his look of fitness.
“I’ve known of this power since last night,” he said slowly. “We were at Mrs. Gordon’s bridge, remember? I was sitting there with that blamed cup on my knees wishing I didn’t have to drink it, when my mind went blank. Absolutely blank.
“It was like being suspended in a dark vault, with someone working on your mind. I could jeel what they — or it, was doing to me. Oh, it didn't hurt. It was just a sense of—awareness. As though someone were operating on me with instruments of telepathy. Knowing just what to do, and going there and getting it over with, quickly. When the feeling went away, I was still sitting there. I hadn’t moved, and no one had noticed anything. It had been accomplished in an incredibly short space of time.
“I recall looking at the tea in the cup, and wishing with all my heart it was a stiff drink. And when I put it to my lips, it was just that—the best liquor I've ever tasted in my life.
“I needed that drink. Especially in view of the fact that it was a drink. Then I thought I heard a voice, whispering to me from far away. I sat still and listened. But the voice, or whatever it was, couldn't get through to me. It tried desperately to tell me something, but the connection was wrong. It gave up after a while.” Jonathan took the cigarette the doctor handed him and puffed in on it, standing in a patch of sunlight, gazing down at the flooring.
“On the way home, I got to wondering about what had happened. I thought, maybe somebody’s made a present to me of terrific mental powers. I looked up at the
moon, and wondered about it.
“The idea came to me: why not concentrate on the moon, and see what would happen. It was to be a test, you see.
“I concentrated, all right.
“The next thing I knew I was standing on it. And oh, boy! the Earth is damn big, looking up, or down, at it.”
The Chief choked on cigarette smoke. He gasped finally, “You mean to tell me you were on the moon?”
“It was the moon, all right. I know. I scrambled right back here on terra Anna in a big hurry, too. There are some things on that satellite of ours—
“This morning I tried destroying matter. You saw how it worked. I’ve tried making things grow. That works, too. It’s unlimited, this power. Anything that is limitless is—infinite.”
Doctor Wooden put his cigarette into a bowl of water. Jonathan flipped his out the window, and watched it arc downwards. They stood silent, frowning. Doctor Wooden roused himself slowly.
“You can turn this gift into the greatest benefit to mankind the world has ever known, Jonathan. You can investigate scientific mysteries at the source. You could find cures. You could—”
Jonathan waved a big hand.
“I know. I’ve thought of all that. But I’m worried. I’ve a feeling that this power was given to me for a certain purpose. To enable me to do something even bigger. No force we know could have done this to me. It came from outside, beyond the Earth. It must have. There is something out there that needs—or wants—me. Maybe that voice did get in a few subconscious suggestions, after all. Wherever it came from, I should find that voice.” “You could explore the universe,” murmured Dr. Wooden thoughtfully.
“I may have to. I’m going to search all space if need be. I can’t hold back. Perhaps the voice implanted that, too. An urge to go out there among the stars and look for it. The wanderlust. It’s a thing like thirst and hunger, that is a part of you.”
“When do you intend leaving?” “Tonight. At once, perhaps.	Why
wait for night? Oh, God, I don’t know what to say, what to think. But I’m going.”
Dr. Wooden caught him by the arm, drawing him into the next room. It was a smaller laboratory, bare but for long chrome tables with metal cradles hung from tripods resting on their tops. In each cradle was pouched a block of crystalline rock formation, semi-transparent, with fine veins of iridescent color interlacing with each other to form weird patterns in the milky depths.
“You're young, Jonathan, and you’re imaginative. I’m not trying to dissuade you. I just want you to consider.”
He put his hands on the rocks in the cradles. These stones were calcatryte, dredged accidently in a scoop shovel off Great Barrier Reef and sent to the National Foundation for testing.
Dr. Wooden bit his lips. Jonathan knew what restraint he was exercising. This research institute was his heart’s dream, with its marble halls and linoleum lab floors, its chrome tables. He had two things in his life: the Institute, and his theory, And Jonathan was part of both.
His theory was this: that somewhere in the world there is an element, a substance, that would emit straight light as one of its properties. Light that did not curve as all light did. Light that would, by its very rigidity, cut through the atomic structure of other matter by the sheer energy of its photons, cutting a path in a thing by ripping electrons from their beds. A light to outmode all cutting and sawing instruments; a ray that would be easy to handle, and inexpensive to operate.
Many elements they had tested and tried; many tested, many thrown aside. When the calcatryte had been brought in, they had not even hoped. But it gave off straight light.
“The credit is yours, Jonathan,” the doctor was saying. “You’ve done a lot. It was your discovery, the tungsten beam that heated the rocks to the pitch high enough to rip those rays from it. Un-curvable rays. A series of lines of un-bendable light. I’ll harness that light, soon.”
“I know. But there’s that urge in me. The wanderlust.”
“You’re giving up a lot. Fame. Maybe fortune.”
Jonathan grinned a little, saying, “Maybe
I’ve gotten a lot more in exchange.”
“Damn it, Jonathan. What the hell’s the matter with me? I’m jealous, boy. If I were in your boots, I’d kick the ribs out of any old codger that tried to talk me out of the greatest experience in the history of mankind!”
Jonathan put his big hand on the other’s shoulder and squeezed it, hard. The Chief took out his handkerchief and blew his nose.
“Let’s go,” he said hoarsely. “There’s no sense in hanging around here any longer. Not when you can go—where you’re going.”
It was a Saturday afternoon. There was no one in the great quadrangle between the buildings. They walked along a path, smoking their farewells together; headed toward the quad.
Jonathan stepped onto the lawn. He bent and undressed, and handed his clothes and shoes to Dr. Wooden.
“I left a letter for you,” he said. “And a power of attorney. I don’t know when I’ll be back. Or—whether.”
Jonathan turned, stood erect; sunlight glinted on the white tones of his flesh, shading the ribs and the ridges of muscle on arms and legs, on shoulder and belly. He lifted his arms, and his face grew hard with his effort at concentration.
Watching, Dr. Wooden smothered a curse. Before his eyes the form of Jonathan Morgan was expanding, growing. Its substance swelled and rippled outward in a vast cloud of tiny motes of matter shimmering and glittering with opalescent hues.
“He’s turned his structure into gas,” he muttered.
The gas that was a man swept upward and onward with the speed of thought itself.
II
ETERNAL night glimmered black and
velvety, flecked with dots of pale blue-white. All around lay the vast universe; silent, but alive with glaring suns and great orbs that were the planets, known and unknown. Here teemed life among the far reaches of vast space.
And like an immortal, living ether, Jonathan Morgan sped onward and outward
into that space. Black meteors went through him and harmed him not. Somehow he found himself aware of them, knowing that they only pushed the gaseous components of his form aside; that when they had passed, his body resumed its former shape. He did know that they could not hurt him; but why, he was unaware.
The infinitely tiny motes of matter that were Jonathan Morgan swelled and grew and expanded. He fled upward and downward with the speed of thought. He grew and towered, and the Earth dropped away below the mad onrush of this strange, galactic giant.
He passed Mars swiftly, casting a curious glance at its canals, seeing half-buried cities beneath ancient sea-bottoms. Beyond the asteroid belt he found frozen Jupiter, and Saturn with its ring, and saw strange forms of life that eked out existences on icy worlds.
In a moment he passed over Pluto and the dark planet beyond it. There was life here, too, of a queer, alien sort. Not flesh, but another form of matter. He thought idly that he would like to study it, but he had not the time.
For the call that had been vague on Earth was now grown peremptory, summoning.
In answer to that call, he fled onward in a rush of gas that seemed to whisper as it sped through the cold voids of space.
In short seconds he was beyond the outermost limits of Sol’s domain, ever expanding . . .
Proxima, nearest star to Sol, glowed brilliant in his path. Beyond it he could see Alpha Centauri, huge and bright. The other stars, too, he recognized. For he was out among the star trails now, and Sol was a dot behind him.
And ever as he flew onward, always as his height grew and grew until he straddled a thousand worlds, the call came clearer. He knew now that he had been summoned from the Earth; knew that ahead of him was an intelligence demanding his presence.
Insanely he flung himself out and up, searching the odd and sometimes terrible worlds that flitted past his eyes. Alien life, spawning on planets so far from Earth that they were undreamed, lived and died
beneath his gaze as he shot by.
The call came clarion clear, at last.
TT said: “Creature of the Third Planet of the sun named Sol. Heed me. You have done well to find me, very well. Turn your gaze this way, Earthling. A little further. Yes, right there.
“The pale yellow planet. You see it? Then hasten, join us. For we have need of every aid that the universe contains. Hurry, Earthling!”
He swirled downward toward the atmospheric belt of the amber orb that swung lazily about a double sun. Even as he compressed his body together, he caught a flicker of queer black lights off to one side in the corners of his eyes. They quivered and throbbed, and almost touched the yellow planet.
Then he was contracting, willing the motes and particles of his body together, shooting downward toward a vast stretch of green sward and rounded white buildings that sprawled gracefully over mile after mile of land.
The black flames burned, forgotten.
He dropped lightly onto his feet on the smooth lawn, felt it give beneath his feet.
“Congratulations,” said a deep voice behind him, and Jonathan whirled.
A gigantic lizard faced him. It stood fifteen feet high, possessed of powerful legs and massive, armoured body. The great reptilian head swayed slightly in regarding him, and the eyes on either side of the broad nostrils were alive with intelligence.
“You—you’re a reptile!” Jonathan
gasped.
“And you—a man,” replied the creature.
Jonathan grinned and said, “I think I was prepared for any form of life but yours. Even pure thought, or beings of non-carbon basic formation. I—hmm. Strikes me we understand each other pretty well.”
The reptile looked puzzled, then grunted.
“I forgot you came from Earth. Earth is a young planet. Her—ah—inhabitants have not made the progress some of our other neighbors have. That is why—why
you were changed, a little. Eli tell you of
that, later.
“But now you must come with me and rest. While your body is unaffected, your mind has been under a terrific concentra-tive strain. It would cause a reaction unless rested. You see, you do not have certain—ah—facilities as yet. Being as you are is too new.”
“Just what am I? I understand your language, or your thoughts, and I've done things I’d have said were impossible, two weeks ago.”
“You will learn. Now you must rest.”
JONATHAN walked with the lumbering being along a crushed stone walk between hedges adroop with riotously colored fruits. Ahead of them glimmered a building, translucently white in the hot beams of the great double-sun now low on the horizon.
“Life forms vary,” said the big reptile. “Here on Neeoorna the reptile life that became extinct on Earth flourished. It evolved more swiftly, due to atmospheric and other conditions. Its intelligence kept pace. In other systems there are things of thought, there are beings with liquid helium in their veins, there are certain others with no veins at all.

“And then, to cheer you, there are still others who might well be named men. They are men, too. They are what you
would call human. They have bodies exactly similar to your own. You shall meet them. All manner of beings live on Nee-oorna these days.”
His voice was heavy. Jonathan glanced quickly at him, sympathetic.
“Something wrong?”
The reptile shook his head soberly, saying, “You will learn, in time.”
A thick glassine door slid noiselessly apart as Jonathan and the Neeoornian neared it. They passed into cool halls of veined green marble lighted so brilliantly that Jonathan remarked it.
“Filaments of glass containing electrified carbon dioxide gases exuded by specially reared plants. Carbon dioxide emits a light much like ordinary daylight. Wc have perfected that until our inner and outer light is the same.”
A rounded chamber whose cool blue walls reflected heat and absorbed moisture contained chairs and tables so similar to Earth products that Jonathan started.
“They look like a futurist’s dream, but they’re remarkably like our own,” he acknowledged.
“This is the Court of Counsellors for bipeds. The other courts are different, naturally, being suited to the individual needs of the various visitors Neeoorna plays host to. Were you or a Zarathzan to enter some of them, you would die instantly from cold and deadly gases, or terrific heat. That is, unless you were forewarned as to what to expect.”
Jonathan puzzled over that for a moment. No amount of foreknowledge made deadly cold any hotter, nor did it turn noxious fumes into pure air. He shrugged. He must be tired, after all. Maybe a rest was what he needed.
The reptile gestured Jonathan to a glassine couch covered with the spotted fur of some jungle beast. It looked soft. It invited him, dumbly. Jonathan dropped on it and stretched out his legs.
“Neeoornians call me Shar Bytu,” said the reptile, gazing down at him. “If you need aught, mention my name. Tell them you are the representative of Earth.” Jonathan knew his eyelids were blotting out sight of the great lizard. He tried to mumble thanks, but a gentle torpor crept about him, embracing his brain, his tired, tired brain. Fie was so tired . . .
A soft hand on his forearm awakened him; brought him up sharply, alarmed, like a panther.
The girl who bent above him drew back in alarm, her violet eyes wide, thin nostrils flared, a cry hovering on her wet red mouth. She looked at Jonathan again and read the swift admiration in his eyes, and smiled.
“You frightened me,” she accused softly, her lips undecided between a pout and a smile. “You are so big, so strong —like a dappled claw-thing of my native Zarathza.”
So this was a Zarathzan. Jonathan found her good to look at. Her skin was a pale lavender, so delicately flushed that it seemed some strange, rare satin. Her hair was black, and coiled in coronas about her intelligent, shapely head. Her deeply glowing eyes were bright with laughter, and Jonathan thought her mouth would be perfect for kisses.
“We are not fighters, we Zarathzans. At least with our bodies, like you Earthlings,” she said, looking at him sidewise. “It has been long since our kind were— beasts.”
Jonathan grinned hugely.
“It’s been a long time since a girl called me that. Must be something about me.”
“Oh,” whispered the girl hurriedly, putting a soft hand to his arm, “I do not mean to offend. Sometimes I admire the —beasts.”
Well, he was getting on. He was keenly aware of her warm hand on his forearm. The girl felt his thought; flushed a little and stood up.
“Shar Bytu sent me to you,” she informed him.
“My thanks to Shar Bytu,” replied Jonathan, throwing aside the fur and rising. Someone had clothed him while he slept. He wore thin trousers that clung to his ankles and bellied outward as they went up. A broad leathern belt fitted snugly around his waist. His great chest was naked. Fur sandals protected his feet.
The girl was likewise clad, with bare midriff and a halter of white fur about her breasts.
“This is the universal garb for counsellors of our make,” the girl said. “Others
A
wear different clothes. Still others wear none, having no sex.”
“I’m Jonathan Morgan. Do Zarath-zans—er—have any names?”
“Silly. Of course. I’m Adatha Za.” Jonathan grinned and said, “Glad to know you. And now that introductions are over, suppose you let me in on the big secret around here. Just what am I doing on Neeooma?”
DATHA ZA was startled.
a
they had emerged from some deeper space, and were voyaging across his, advancing inexorably, like flames of fire lapping across thin paper.
The girl’s bare shoulder pressed his, trembling.
“I’m frightened, Earthman/’ she whispered. “When I think of Zarathza in the path of that—those blights from hell, I— oh, I don’t know how to say it!”
You do not know? Didn’t Shar either. Not knowing. Happy until realiza-
“Yes,” he answered soberly. “It isn’t nice to think of Earth waiting her turn,
tion comes—
Earth! It was so far away, so secure and homey. Unaware of this danger growing millions of light years from it, a danger threatening extinction to men and the pursuits of men, eating like a living monster into the suns and planets. Jonathan put an arm around the girl; held her against him. Lonely, they stood together, awed.
The girl lifted her head and smiled tremulously. She tossed her head and her hair brushed her shoulders.
“Let’s forget them,” she brightened. “I succeed pretty well. It’s just—at times— that I feel low down.”
“I feel low myself. Don’t anyone know anything about them ? Can’t somebody think of something?”
Adatha Za leaned back against the marble rail of the balcony and looked at him and said, “You are big and strong. What would you do to something that was threatening you?”
“I’d fight,” he grunted.
“We fight, too. But our opponent always wins. And when we fight, we always die.”
Adatha Za sighed. Looking down at her, seeing the sweetly curved mouth that not-quite pouted and the straight thin nostrils and deep, dark eyes fringed with long lashes, Jonathan realized she was a rarely beautiful girl. He felt suddenly as though he had been jabbed sharply under the ribs.
“Seeing you makes me want to fight something,” he grinned, laughing a little. “Funny, I haven’t felt like this since I was in high school. It’s like the little boy who turns somersaults before the pretty little girl who’s just moved next door. I guess
Bytu tell—but perhaps he left that to me, seeing that I am not a—reptile.”
Jonathan looked her over and laughed,
“I’m mighty glad you’re not,” and he noticed that Adatha Za—whose civilization was eons beyond that of Earth—looked pleased.
They walked toward a balcony overlooking a bed of scarlet flowers patterned between strips of green grass.
Great lights beamed into the blackness of the Neeoornian night from high on the parapets, lighting the scene before them.
And high in the heavens, black and moving against the blue of the starry sky, strange shadows chased one another be-ween the stars.
Adatha Za lifted a bare arm and pointed to that great blotch in the heavens. Her arm trembled against Jonathan even she pointed, and he read stark fear in her eyes and in the drooping corners of her scarlet mouth.
“You see those black flames? No one knows what they are. They kill us, one by one, when we attempt to fight them. They are growing. Already they have eaten one of the moons of this planet. Soon they will reach Neeoorna itself—indeed, they are past the fringe of the heavenside. And after Neeoorna they will eat the twin suns, and other suns and other planets. Zarathza and Earth, too. There will be nothing beyond the black flames, Earthling. It will eat our entire universe!”
Jonathan was aware that his spine tingled, looking up. He felt deep inside him, the alienness of those dancing darknesses.
They were not of the known universe.
They came from somewhere outside, from another world. So different from Earth that their mere presence spelled doom for I never noticed the little girl before.”

alight; but her thin brows raised, faintly
questioning.
“Some—somersaults? What is that?”
“Oh, just a way of showing off. Putting your head down and—here, I’ll show you.”
He dropped to the tiled flooring of the balcony and tumbled. Halfway over, he found himself looking upside-down at a tall figure who glared down at him incredulously. Jonathan flushed hotly and landed hard.
He sat there and felt foolish.
Adatha Za started up, catching her breath in her throat.
Jonathan drew a deep breath. There was a strange malignancy in the eyes of this man who stood in the arched entranceway and looked down at him. Malignancy and contempt, and his thin lips sneered with the livid disdain that moved him.
“You’re just asking for trouble, mac,” he said quietly, getting to his feet. “I’m not used to being looked at like that.”
The man stood straight and haughty, but his eyes blazed. Jonathan felt as though he had been spat at. He started forward; felt Adatha Za’s hand on his arm, squeezing him hard.
“This is Morka Kar, Jonathan. He is from Zarathza. This is the Earthling, Jonathan Morgan.”
The Zarathzan did not incline his head. He flashed an irritated look at Adatha Za, then looked back at Jonathan.
“The guests of Shar Bytu have gathered to meet the barbarian,” he snapped. “He sent me to see if he were awake. I see he is. Be good enough to show him the Temple, Adatha Za.”
He swung on his heel and walked away. Jonathan quivered and took a step after him, but the girl beside him tugged on his arm, saying, “It is always his way. He is abrupt, and so self-controlled that anything like gaiety annoys him.”
Jonathan grunted. His lips that had been hard, slowly softened.
“That baby was just begging for a left hook,” he growled. “And something tells me he’ll get it, too.”
“Morka Kar is a great scientist. I came in his retinue from Zarathza, to help fight the flames.”
“I still don’t like him!” Jonathan drew a deep breath and asked, “He—he isn’t
Mate, I mean* Or—your
Adatha Za laughed.
“You use quaint expressions. But I follow your thoughts. No, he is not my husband, nor my engaged. But he does want me. You see, on Zarathza I am tapu. Sworn to science research, forbidden to wed a Zarathzan.”
Janathan reflected on that for a moment. He glanced sidewise at her and grinned, “What about an—Earthman?”
Adatha Za pinched his arm and laughed, “Strictly, there’s nothing against it. Zarathza never even heard of Earth until recently!”
Ill
THE Temple of Embassy gleamed in ethereal beauty under the beams of Neeoorna’s five moons. Its ivory pillars lifted slender fingers to the black basalt dome. About its periphery an arched court circled to the entrance where its massive metal gates were embossed with crouching griffins.
* Jonathan and Adatha Za passed along the magnificently marbled corridors and entered a deep council room tiered with seats. He paused in the doorway and stared.
On salt white benches the representatives of a thousand worlds turned and looked at him. There were reptiles from Neeoorna, lavendar-tinted Zarathans, blo-bous creatures from distant Sarboola, thought things of far galaxies, ethereal Tartulians, and queer black beasts that had the intelligence of genius. Against one wall glass enclosures held beings from planets so cold they needed artificial refrigeration to live here. Near the opposite side of the chamber, steamy glass vases held other life forms whose structure needed tremendous heat to exist.
There was a tall round rostrum of some glimmering metal raised like a throne in the center of the room. There stood Shar Bytu, towering over the assembled hundreds. There was a flash of his greenish forearm, and Jonathan stepped forward.
a
“Approach us, Jonathan Morgan,” Shar Bytu called. “We of Neeoorna and the worlds of our universes have waited for you. You are the only Earth creature we
could contact, though we tried many. Come, join us.”
As he went down the aisle, Jonathan cast sidewise glances at the utterly alien beings that stood and looked at him. Here and there, though, he saw others like himself and the Zarathzans. Humans. Men with two arms and two legs. Women with lissome figures and soft red mouths. He felt a little warmer, and held his head higher, after seeing them.
He came up the steps and stood beside Shar Bytu. The reptile nodded, smiling somewhat.
“We had set great hopes on you, Earthling. Before your eyes you see creatures of bafflement and wonder tinged with a near-despair. The shadowy flames are a mystery and a menace to us. We had hoped—we had hoped strongly, that you might bring the solution to their strange deadliness. I know now they are as queer to you as to us/'
“There’s more than those flames that’s queer to me,” # replied Jonathan grimly. “First on the list is how I ever managed to get here at all. Where I got all those tricky powers from—”
“That,” deprecated Shar Bytu by a gesture of his six-clawed hand. “That is but a simple explanation. You will understand it when I point it out. You are merely the ultimate goal of evolution.”
“Oh,” nodded Jonathan, and wondered if he looked blank.
“What is the ultimate goal of evolution but perfection?” resumed the reptile. “On Earth Nature has experimented with the dinosaur, the bird, the fish. One by one she discarded them because they were not fit to survive their environment. But all the while Nature was learning. It was making strides. It tested and discarded. The reptile and the early forms of bird and fish and insect life were tossed into the discard. Nature knew there was something lacking.
“She made man. She gave man the inherent ability to fit himself to any environment. She gave man a brain, a brain that gave off energy in the form of thought. Measured energy. Electrical energy. Energy that can be measured and graphed. But Nature, prodigal in her gifts, was also prodigal with man's mind. She gave man nine million brain cells—far more than he ever used Only a great genius used one
percent of those cells!
“Then why was Nature so lavish? In man she had reached her absolute ultimate. There only remained for man to perfect the tremendous, unguessed power of his brain. By thought! By sending out beams of sheer solid thought, by dipping into those millions of brain cells for the ultimate power, the power that would make man—perfect!”
Jonathan closed his eyes, shuddering. He opened his eyes and looked at Shar Bytu.
“How do you know all this?” he whispered.
HE thought in the frightened core of him of changes in the space-time continuum, that unguessable eons may have rolled past since last he left the Earth. That Earth was old beyond thought—•
Shar Bytu chuckled, “No, I do not have the gift of prophecy, nor am I repeating history. Except by analogy. For as Nature has treated us of a hundred and sixteen suns, so Nature will treat man. Nature and evolution are inexorable, being linked with time. And so she will produce the perfect man—the man absolutely adapted to his own environment.
“We of Neeoorna did this to you, by certain—ah—methods. We operated on you by means known to our scientists for ages. When we have an atavar in our clinics, we open his mind fully to enable him to throw off all connection with past ages. So it was with you. It was not difficult.
“As a result, you are a man immune to harm. You have absolute control over your body, over inanimate objects that exist about you. Once you are aware of what danger threatens, you may avert it by so arranging the electronic groupings within your body either to merge and blend with the danger, or harden into a shield of antidote or corrective.
“Of course, as your brain evolved, it needed the body to feed it, to give it energy. Thus the body became an essential part of it. But the body changed, too. the body will respond to any environment, as a necessary corollary of the brain.
“In short, you are the ultimate evolution It became the perfect tool of the mind. It did anything the mind ordered it to. So of the third planet of the Sun Duryu. Or Sol.”
JONATHAN drew a deep breath. He knew with deepest conviction that he had heard truth, bizarre as it was. He was not a man any more. He knew that, within himself. He was as far beyond man, or would be now, with study, as men were above the Neanderthals. He was ultimate man. Man in his final stage. Man multiplied by all the powers that be. Man to the nth degree.
Man nth!
“Now that I’m here, I’ve failed you,” he grunted hoarsely.
“Not yet. Oh, no. Many of us have failed. They are no longer—here. We still hope that you may, out of your experiences on Earth, construct us an edifice upon which our scientists may find some clue, some hint. All we ask is some idea as to what it is we face. Just a thought. One tiny clue.
“But now you must see how we fight ourselves.”
A gigantic, bulbous being, a fishbelly-white due to the heavy cloud formation that sheathed its native planet five light years from Neeoorna, rose to his feet. He turned his many-faceted eyes to the rostrum.
“Shar Bytu,” he intoned sonorously, “I ask the right of test for us of the planet Moratoyo. We would seek to cast a shower of atoms at the flames. We have made recent improvements over our former weapon—”
Shar Bytu nodded, and his clawed hand brought an ebony mallet upon the rosewood pulpit where he stood.
“So granted. Session adjourned. The guests of Neeoorna will meet at the proving grounds.”
In silence the scientists filed from their seats. Jonathan caught sight of Adatha Za among the Zarathzan delegates, and ran to her. Her hand nestled warmly in his. She flashed her dark eyes at him and smiled.
“I’m more out of place here than an atheist in church,” he said. “Stick to me. I still have to get my bearings.”
Her fingers tensed on his, squeezing. He heard her whispered, “I will.”
The proving grounds lay semi-circular behind a great green spread of lawn. At
the north end of the vast field an arc of white marble terraces lifted rosy columns to the sky. Below the pillars stretched marble benches, now rapidly filling with emissaries.
The Moratoyons marched to a gleaming gun set in concrete in the center of the dusty field behind the lawn. The gun shone a queer white, with two red domes surmounting its breech, and fitted on either side with knobs and levers. It quivered and gleamed in the heat haze that shifted over the proving sands.
Jonathan felt Adatha Za press against him with thigh and shoulder. She choked a whisper to his ears, “It is their atom-gun. It cannot be compared with some others we have seen, but if they’ve improved it—” her voice broke with a soundless sob. “We hope it may work. But we are—afraid.”
Jonathan could almost feel the anxiety and hope around him like a living thing. From the somewhat transparent thought beings of Sallarsee to the robotmen of Kankang, each sat watchful; grim, intent. Those who had lips tensed them to thin lines. Those who had eyes narrowed them expectantly. The others floated or stood, quiescent.
The Moratoyons on the field moved swiftly. They clamped brakes and levers down and locked them; spun wheels and twisted dials. From the steel and cement cradle where it rested, the great cylinder of dull white metal lifted its blunt nose slowly, almost cautiously, and aimed it at the sky.
“It shoots atoms supercharged with light-photons,” whispered Adatha Za.
The chief scientist of all Moratoyo paused and looked at Shar Bytu, who nodded. The Moratyoon whirled, shouting harshly, watching his men leap for the firing dials.
One after another the dials spun.
The firing pin was punched.
“God!” choked Jonathan hoarsely, staring in numb horror.
Where once the gun stood bright and shining there was a faint red mist that hung close to earth, beating bloodily in the flood of the arc carbon-dioxide lamps as though welling with life. Then it began to dissipate as a faint breeze wafted across the field.
There was a little hole in the ground,
where the gun had been,
Jonathan became aware slowly of Adatha Za’s hand that clung like a vise about his left wrist. Pie looked at her, saw her eyes convulsively closed; saw two tears trickling from beneath her long dark lashes.
Her moist red mouth trembled as she whispered, “They all fail. All of them. Like that. One moment they are here. Then they are gone. It is almost as if they destroyed themselves.,,
Jonathan put an arm around her naked shoulders and hugged her against his chest.
“Buck up,” he grated. “We aren’t licked yet. Why, hell! We haven’t started to fight, yet!”
He saw Morka Kar sneering at him from two stadium seats away, his thin mouth curling in fanatical contempt. He felt the hate beat redly from the man’s eyes. Jonathan bared his teeth in answer to that fierce, unspoken taunt.
He said, loud enough for the Zarathzan to hear, “One of us will find a way. We’re bound to. There’s a key to that riddle. There has to be. The universe can’t end —not like this—”
“Perhaps,” said Morka Kar loudly, “the Earthling might amuse the shadows by —tumbling ?”
Jonathan didn’t know until later that Adatha Za put out a hand to restrain him. He was away like a sprinter, and his big left fist was lifting, swiftly. His fist hit Morka Kar, a little to one side of his jaw.
It snapped the Zarathzan’s head around and backwards, and lifted him off his feet, and dropped him three seats below.
MORKA KAR lay there outstretched,
unmoving. Jonathan grinned hugely and rubbed his knuckles. It began to penetrate after a while that the others were staring at him in complete horror.
Adatha Za gasped and sobbed, then came and stood silently beside him, her soft hand reaching for his fist. She held her dark head high, and her eyes glared defiance.
“A beast—”
“—useless to expect help from things still ruled by emotion—”
“—a mistake. Shar Bytu should not—” He heard the murmurs and the whis-
pers, but Adatha Za was speaking, saying, “Morka Kar insulted him before the assembly was called. He is not like us, this Earthling. He fights when he is attacked!”
Shar Bytu waddled forward, his reptilian face grave. He blinked a little curious, at Jonathan.
“We cannot have disturbances among ourselves,” he said. “We need scientific and philosophic calm to meet the shadow menace.”
“It wasn’t what he said,” Jonathan said softly. “It was the way he said it. He was asking for it?”
“Asking for what?” puzzled Shar Bytu, looking about.
The reptile, moving his ponderous head in looking for what Morka Kar had asked, struck Jonathan as unconsciously funny. He grinned, and was buoyed up.
He said, “I’m sorry. I don’t want to break up any gathering like this. Apparently my action strikes you as something primitive. I don’t look at it that way at all. I didn’t ask to be brought here, or to be given the powers to make the trip. Now that I’m here, however, I’ll do everything I can to help. Naturally. But no Zarathzan’s going to walk all over me whenever he feels like it.”
A snarl answered him. Morka Kar was climbing unsteadily to his feet, aided by two Goqualian metallic robotmen.
“Shar Bytu,” fumed the Zarathzan, shaking off the hands that held him. “It has been long since a being of my standing indulged in personal combat, but I wish to meet this Earthling. Just the two of us. Face to face, mind to mind, in mental monomachy!”
Adatha Za went white. Shar Bytu looked gravely unhappy.
Shar Bytu whispered, “I had hoped to learn something from the Earth man—”
Jonathan interrupted, “You’re all conceding victory to Morka Kar. Maybe so, maybe not. That isn't just what I want to say, though. The main thing that occupies us is the problem of the flames, or shadows.
“Much as I hate to admit it, I’m afraid I’m not much help against them. You see, when you gave me the powers of ultimate evolution, my scientific and other knowledge didn’t keep pace with them. There are thousands of Earth men who would have made better ambassadors than I. Apparently I was more psychic, perhaps more malleable in brain structure, than they. I don’t presume to know the whys and wherefors of that. I’m here and I’m glad I’m here. If I can help, I will.
“But—much as I hate to admit it, I’m out of my depth. Those shadows, or whatever it is out there in space, is beyond me. So if you lose me—which I hope you don’t —you aren’t losing too much.”
Jonathan took a deep breath; went on, “A poet on Earth once said something about not loving a woman loved he not honor more. Well, I love the universe, but I’m not hiding behind any danger to it when a man wants to fight me for a woman I—love.”
He heard Adatha Za’s quickened breathing ; felt her hand touch his arm and squeeze. He stood there with her hand on his arm and looked about him, at the thought beings and the robotmen and the reptiles. On a few faces, on the faces of those who looked most like men, he read a grave applause. On the features of the others, a blank attention, as though he spoke of geology to a monkey. They just couldn’t get his viewpoint at all.
But Morka Kar did, and he snarled. His sullen mouth writhed and his eyes glowed fiercely as he glanced from Adatha Za to Jonathan.
“Another thing,” grated Jonathan, and he looked Morka Kar full in the eyes, “I may be an animal, but I know others who possess animal characteristics—no matter what they mistakenly call themselves.” Morka Kar fought in the metal arms of the robotmen who flanked him. Shar Bytu turned and fixed him with a cold eye.
“You will be still, Zarathzan,” he whispered icily. “I have long heard your taunts to one or another of our group. As yet the deputation from Zarathza has not attempted the flames, though I have heard many words spoken by them of it.” Morka Kar quieted swiftly.
“The mental monomachy will occur tomorrow at this place. Until then I forbid Morka Kar and the Earthling to meet. If harm befalls either of them, the other shall pay with his life. See to it.”
He turned and waddled away. Morka Kar seethed a glance at Jonathan, then followed the reptile. The others split into
groups, silently transmitting puzzled
thoughts.
ADATHA ZA sat on the stone bench and looked up at him, and her red mouth was rueful. Her eyes beneath the dark fringes of her lashes accused him.
“I had hoped that some day you would visit Zarathza with me,” she said softly. “Now you—”
“Now nothing has changed,” grinned Jonathan, dropping beside her and taking her soft hands between his. “Shar Bytu made me infinite, didn’t he? How can Morka Kar hurt me?”
Her eyes widened in concern. “But Morka Kar is also infinite, as you put it. He will fight your mind. You do not know the sciences that Morka Kar knows. Not knowing what he can do against you, you will be helpless. He will stun your brain, drive it mad, then—destroy it.”
“If I can’t think as fast as that bullying windbag, I’m willing to be destroyed.” Adatha Za sounded annoyed. “It is not a question of thinking fast, although that does enter into it. It is more a matter of knowing how to oppose the weapons that Morka Kar will create to fight you.”
“—that he will create?”
“Certainly. Of old on Zarathza, men carried swords and shields. Later they used percussion guns, still later, atomic disintegrators. But as the years passed into eons, and as life on Zarathza evolved, it was discovered that these weapons were of no use against a trained mind that could shoot a bolt of mental force against the weapon to destroy it. So men went naked into combat and there they thought up their weapons swiftly, through force of mind alone. Their opponents met their mental creations with defenses and weapons of their own. The more unsual the weapon, the easier it was to decide the victor.”
Jonathan whistled.
“My ideas on weapons stop about at a .45 caliber automatic. A sword is useless. So’s a bow and arrows. Or a spear. You say Zarathza had atomic disintegrators a long time ago, eh?”
The girl shivered.
“Atomic disintegrators are seen only in museums today,” she whispered. “And you of Earth do not even have them. Lai-lista! You are a dead man walking around.”
“Hey,” chuckled Jonathan, grabbingher arms and pulling her around to face him. “Chin up. I may not know much about weapons, but I’ll bet I’ve still got a trick or two up my sleeve. I’ll show that windbag where he gets off. You wait. You’ll see.”
Her eyes begged his for reassurance. She lay close against him and her mouth quivered into a smile.
“You were—joking me, then? You do know of weapons that you haven’t mentioned ?”
“Sure,” he boasted gaily. “Lots of them. Brass knuckles. Galloping dominoes. A ginrickey. A mickey finn. The Brooklyn Dodgers.”
“I am so glad,” she whispered. “That makes me feel so much better.”
She did not see his frown as she walked with him across the white composition walk toward their guest quarters. He wasn’t thinking of himself. He was wondering what Morka Kar would do to her —after he got through with him.
“Just the same,” the girl was saying, “I think that I will show you some of the weapons Morka Kar may use. Those, at least, that I know. We will go and sit together beneath the moons, and I will teach them to you, one after the other.”
Jonathan looked at her red mouth and grinned, “I’ll show you a weapon, too. On Earth we call it a—kiss.”
The night was warm and the moons that hurtled across the Neeoornian sky shed a pale lustre on the gardens where Adatha Za and Jonathan Morgan sat. Between her legs lay a box filled with strips of queerly colored metals, vials of shining dull and iridescent chemicals, containers and compartments of tubes and alloys.
“It is from these that Morka Kar will fashion his weapons,” she said, fingering the objects before her. “From the mints provided by the monomachy coffer, he will be enabled to throw weapon after weapon at you. For instance, this—from this he will make a molecular magnetizer that will cause the molecules that make up your body so to attract each other that your body will shrink in upon itself—assume the density of a dwarf star—fall through the earth to the center of this planet! Or with this he could form a ray that is hot as the hottest sun in the universe. He may not use that. It is a weapon that even Morka Kar fears. It is too deadly. Were it to escape his mental control, it could blow up the entire planet. Now from this tube—”
Jonathan listened dutifully. He was in this away over his head, and no amount of last minute cramming would help. To assimilate this knowledge would require years. He wasn’t quitting, but he realized that if he did win, it would be by some method purely Earthian, and not by a study of Zarathzan weaponry.
He looked at Adatha Za. He put his hands on her soft shoulders and turned her toward him. Her eyes were questioning.
“We have a weapon on Earth, too,” he whispered. “It’s a kiss. Do you Zarath-zans have the kiss?”
With arched brows the girl followed his thought, then shook her head a little disdainfully, saying, “No. That does not seem to be any sort of armament I know. Is is a good weapon?”
“The best there is on a night like this —with a girl like you.”
HER mouth was warm and soft and moist beneath his. His lips held hers for a long time before he let her go. She opened her long-lashed eyes slowly, staring at him.
“That is no weapon,” she accused softly. She put her arms up and drew his head down again, whispering, “—but I like it. I should really study it some more.”
This time it was the girl whose lips clung.
Jonathan laughed, “For a Zarathzan you catch on pretty quickly.”
“I’m a scientist,” she retorted.
Nestled in his arms, with her hair flooding his chest and shoulder, Adatha Za said, “I wish—I wish that you and I could go back to Zarathza together, Jonathan Morgan. In my villa beside the Jaralayan Sea I would love to study this kiss-weapon of yours. It is such a nice weapon, even though it does frighten me a little.”
She gasped suddenly and tried to sit up, but Jonathan’s long arms held her.
“Now what’s eating you?” he wanted to know.
That kiss—how many

Jonathan chuckled, “Next thing you’ll be telling me I do it like an expert!”
Head to one side, Adatha Za surveyed him. At last she nodded pertly, laughing a little.
“Yes, I think you do. And no one ever became perfect without practice!”
“Don’t forget. Shar Bytu made me a perfectionist.”
Adatha Za sighed as she nestled back into his arms, and whispered, “There are some things, Jonathan Morgan, that even evolution can’t do.”
IV
ADATHA ZA came for him the next
day, to go with him to the Arena. Her eyes were dark and sunken, her soft red mouth quivering. Her hair hung loose, uncoiffed. She came into his arms and kissed him; drew back to look up into his face, trembling.
“I am glad for last night,” she whispered. “Though I did have hopes—some day in my villa over the Jaralalyan Sea—” She buried her face against his chest, moving it slowly from side to side, distrait.
“Hey,” yelped Jonathan, lifting her face with a finger beneath her chin. “Why the gloom? I thought we’d decided last night that I had a chance.”
“You did—last night. Today . . . today Shar Bytu announced that the winner of the mental monomachy is to attempt the black shadows! So—”
“Oof,” Jonathan grunted, “that sort of knocks the stilts out from under a guy. No matter who wins, both will die, unless —no, the age of miracles passed a long time ago. What does Morka Kar say to that ?”
“Oh, he raved and swore, but he dared do nothing to disobey. After all, he is a scientist, and he is here to fight those flames. Even he cannot hope to fight all the scientists on Neeoorna right now. I— I think he will temporize. Have the monomachy declared a draw. That will allow him to save face and his life at the same time.”
“I’m going to win if I can,” Jonathan
said slowly. “I just don’t cotton to that
guy.”
Her long fingernails bit into the flesh of his wrists. Her voice was hoarse, desperate, “By Lallista’s brood, Jonathan! Do not anger him. Your one chance is in Morka Kar’s willingness to spare you that he may spare his own self. If he loses that temper of his—Jonathan, I want you alive.”
He patted her bare shoulder, smiling.
“I’ll still see that villa on the sea, honey. Don’t fret your lovely head about it. But it’s time to go, now. I don’t want this affair called off on a forfeit.”
They walked slowly, hand in hand, along the pebbled path to the great white Amphitheatre. It rose tall and grim, brooding over the lovely square that fronted its entrance. The square was deserted. Their footfalls sounded loud in their ears.
They went up the steps and through the oval doorway. Alone, they went down the black corridor toward the arena.
The seats were filled, inside the arena room. The batteries of ten thousand eyes gloomed at Jonathan as he walked toward the great ivory chair set on the sanded field. He knew Morka Kar watched him from the ebony throne opposite the ivory chair, but he’d be damned before he’d glance his way!
Jonathan settled himself in the seat before he looked at his opponent. Morka Kar sat facing him, both arms resting on the ebony arms. His thin mouth was twisted in a sardonic grin. His red-shot eyes glistened with hate.
Adatha Za came forward with an oblong coffer, ornate with jewels. Dropping to her knees, she unlocked the cover, and threw it open. Inside, row on row, glittered vials and retorts of liquids and powders, and long metal bars and needles.
Above Adatha Za’s naked shoulders, Jonathan watched a three-legged Paravian dance-walk its way to Morka Kar. The Paravian also carried a monomachy casket.
Adatha Za spoke swiftly: “As you see his weapon form, combat it. Use the antidote. Not knowing that,” she was choking now, almost sobbing, “not knowing that, attack the weapon with your mind. It has existence, but it is a mentally energized existence. Mental energy may dis-

sipate it if strong enough. It is not considered good form—but it is safe.”
The dark eyes shimmered through tears as she looked up at him.
“Farewell,” she whispered. *
And turned and fled.
Morka Kar stretched out a foot and kicked shut the cover of the coffer before his throne. The clunk of the closing lid sounded loud in the high chamber, merging with the breathless gasp that shook the throng. Only a mathless monomachy fighter scorned the help of the box.
Jonathan looked at Morka Kar and grinned.
He put out his own foot and slammed the cover down. Dimly he caught, in some remote recess of his brain, the amaze that held the onlookers. They didn’t know, as did Adatha Za, that the contents of that box were as much a mystery to Jonathan as were the black shadows. He’d be better off without it. It gave him less to think about, and he needed all his powers of thought.
Morka Kar snarled. His eyes blazed right at Jonathan—
Purple balls hung in the air before the Zarathzan!
They shimmered and glittered, filled with opalescent mists of green and red and white and purple. They danced eerily, as though drunk, as though to the music of some alien piper. They bounced and swayed on invisible strings in a wild and eerie saraband. They swung outward, circling.
Then darted straight at Jonathan.
JONATHAN threw every bit of mental power at his control into his defense, but the first bubble did not break before it got within three feet of him. The others fell apart easily after that.
Jonathan frowned, and an automatic hung in the air before him. It turned to grey mists and faded, struck by a bolt of liquid fire.
Morka Kar rasped laughter, “Do better Earthling. We of Zarathza have forgotten weapons such as that.”
A haze of colorless hue quivered in front of the Zarathzan. It seemed only a heat haze; but when he saw the sandy waste inside the shimmer, when he saw grey and

rolling ocean instead of the sand, and saw ocean turn to roaring flames, he knew he looked on a weapon utterly foreign to Earth thought.
His knuckles bulged until the skin over them whitened in the fury of his concentration. Gasping, he saw the shimmer fade.
He cast a beam of radio-waves; saw them strike a beam of like power and shatter, useless. He hurled acid. It met an alkali. He threw a bullet and watched it melt in a shield of heat that turned the lead to smoke.
All the while the Zarathzan taunted him, shrilling, “Ape. Go back to the steamy jungles of your planet, ape. We do not need a loose-brain here. Go back, ape!”
A red triangle formed in the air before Morka Kar even as he spoke. It glowed and burned with green hell-fires. Jonathan dropped water on it and the green fires raged and grew and expanded, feeding on the water.
Jonathan shuddered when he finally extinguished them. Beads of cold sweat rose on his forehead. He was growing weaker. His brain could not stand this punishment. He had been subjecting it to too much. It would give, soon. It was not conditioned, as was the Zarathzan’s.
He thought fleetingly of last night, with Adatha Za’s mouth burning beneath his. Never to know that mouth again! She had trusted in his strength, in his boasts. She had told him of her villa above the sea. Now he was to fail her. He had bragged of a mickey Ann. Of brass knuckles. What a crude jest. He had even mentioned—
Jonathan sat upright. He thought.
When Morka Kar saw the club in his hands, he hooted.
“A club! The ape has found a club with which to kill. Lallista! He jests.”
Jonathan swung the wood in his hands with easy familiarity. He lifted it above his shoulders, then brought it about viciously. There was a sudden splat.
Morka Kar, still laughing his derision, crumpled and toppled from the ebony seat.
Jonathan discovered his knees shaking. He sat down quickly.
Adatha Za came running, sobbing, laughter.
“You beat him. You beat him. What a strange weapon. What was it? Morka Kar thought it but a club. He did not deign to spend his mental forces on it. But you fooled him 1”
Jonathan held up the wood and shook it, laughing, “This is known in America as a baseball bat. A Louisville slugger. The old hickory, the ash. And the thing that hit Morka Kar was a baseball. Gods! A jest, he called it.”
Shar Bytu looked from Morka Kar to Jonathan, saying, “You must destroy him. It is the great rule of mental monomachy.”
But Jonathan shook his head, wearily. '
Shar Bytu looked down at the Zarathzan. He almost seemed to relish what he did. But it was over in an instant. A few grains of dust settled groundwards. Jonathan felt sick.
The others gathered around him. Their voices were excited.
“A new weapon to fight the flames.”
“The Earthling has solved our problem.”
“If it baffled a monomachy fighter like Morka Kar, it might work on the flames.”
Jonathan tried to explain, looking down at their faces.
“No, no,” he cried out, talking down their thoughts. “It isn’t a weapon. It’s a sport we play back on Earth. I—it—the bat is used to hit a ball. Morka Kar didn’t know that. He thought it just a club.
“Luckily, I could call my shot. A straight fast ball. Not a curve. A straight—”
Jonathan blinked. He stopped, choking; eyes wide.
“Maybe,” he whispered. “Maybe—”
The others grew quiet, watching. They felt his intense excitement, saw his hands quiver, and the way his lips twitched. Adatha Za clung to his arm and her eyes were pools of purple hunger.
It wasn’t too fantastic—yet.
It all depended on straight lines and curves, and whether a straight line can ever be curved. The shortest distance between two points. If the straight line could be moved to turn, then he was wrong.
But if he were right! If this type of straightness could not curve, then it might conceivably eat its way through a universe
which was based on something that should curve: light.

DR. WOODEN and he had made strides in their experiments on light rays derived from calcatryte. They had explored the quantum theory, had forced homogenous light against a metal plate and seen the electrons it extracted from it. This light energy had been partially turned into the kinetic energy of the bombarded electrons of metal.
From this it had been a step upward in discovering that calcatryte yielded a photon shower of such terrific concentration that it ate right through the metal plate; had given no evidence of stopping until they had constructed the plasticite screen: pure black, coated with a fine dust of calcatryte itself.
They had no way of knowing whether the rays stopped at the screen, exactly. They might go on and on. And if they ate through metal, releasing the electrons that composed it—they might eat through the universe!
Jonathan shuddered and looked around him.
He knew his course, now. But to prove
it—
He had to go through the flames!
“You proclaimed that the winner of the mental monomachy would go through the flames, Shar Bytu,” he said. “As winner, and as representative of Earth, I claim that right.”
Shar Bytu looked at him and his eyes were like flecks of cold moonlight. Suddenly, they twinkled.
“The right is yours, Earthling. And something tells me that you may, at long last, be the one to succeed. I read it in your mind. Yes, your theory is a good one. To think that menace came from Earth. From little, uncivilized, barbaric Earth.”
He waddled away, his ponderous reptilian head moving from side to side.
Adatha Za pressed her hot cheeks against Jonathan’s chest. Her voice was low, troubled: “How will you fight the flames, Jonathan? What weapon is there
that can destroy them ?”
“No weapon under all the stars and all the suns can destroy the shadows, Adatha Za. They are alien. The only hope there
is—is to shut them off.”

DREAMER MAN
I’ve never been to the planet, Mars, though at times, I’ve thought that what I really need is a two-weeks’ vacation on some such place. (Who knows, maybe I’ll get one. One is never sure where he’ll end up when he starts out to be an artist.) Of course, I’ve been out of this world before, but only figuratively speaking, and that certainly was not the case when I met Mr. Chet Whitehorn, Editor of Planet.
I was looking for work up at his office, and he presented me with a word picture of some fantastic half-man, three-quarters beast, to be used in an illustration. Now, Chet’s really okay, but at times he gets some rather peculiar ideas about art, as is the case with most editors—or maybe it’s me who’s wrong—I’ve known that to happen, too. But that’s what we artists have to put up with. We manage—somehow. We’re a rugged lot.
At any rate, my introduction to the working details of the outer Universe left my poor mind in somewhat of a dither. After all, I’m only a farm boy, steeped in the moo-o-o-ings and neigh-ings of the barnyard. I know about muskrats, have made personal contacts with skunks and even succeeded in getting butted in the rear by a pet ram. But when I was suddenly thrown up into the lands of celestial imagination, my very dreams were invaded. Day and night, awake or asleep, grotesque creatures groped their way in and out of my subconscious, slithering, hairy things slid silently from one brain cell to another while in the background lurked a host of mis-shapen, hideous monsters, their wide eyes staring as they crouched and menaced in the eternal gloom of outer space. And, through it all, with firm step and steadfast faith in her limpid eyes, slowly strode a lightly-clad and bee-u-tiful maiden, radiant and luscious, followed by our little hero and his ray-gun.
I don’t remember how I got started on this business of being an artist. (I suppose there are a few nasty people who look at my stuff and wonder why I want to keep on being one.)
If I keep at it long enough, it’s possible I may be able to walk into a publisher’s office and be greeted with the respect due a great personage, but I doubt it. By that time they’ll know me too well.
Oh, well, that’s the way life is, I suppose. At the moment I feel more like dashing off a snappy PLANET illustration than being a philosopher. Where did I leave my rocket ship? Who knows, perhaps one day I, too, shall crack up my trusty little ship on some far-off planet, meet a real live Princess of Venus and spend the rest of my days looking up at the little bright world in the sky that I used to look up from.
H. W. Kibmle.

He shot up rapidly from the sanded floor of the Arena. Beneath him for one long instant, he saw Adatha Za with her lovely face upturned: hands clasped between her breasts, red mouth bitten until it swelled, dark eyes misted. Shar Bytu stood beside her, his scaly hide brushing her naked arm. The others were grouped twos and threes: silent and motionless, watching him.
How long they stood there, Jonathan never knew. His mind was fully occupied in a furious effort of incredible concentra-tive power: forcing his body into the rigid and alien pattern that his mind knew would alone spell safety from disaster.
Light that never deviated from its straight and ruthless path. Light that would absorb matter, that would shower a stream of electrons from it, releasing the electrons in a blast of power that fed upon the stuff it touched. Such were the black shadows!
And as he hurtled onward into the flames, he forced his body into beams of light, rigid and unbending. He had to merge with the flames, or be destroyed.
He hurtled onward, toward the ebony maw that shook and glistened and bellied against the dark of space like a translucent blob of jelly.
He held out his hands like a diver, going into the shadows. The movement helped him concentrate on straightness. The wind and the blackness was about him, licking at his lighteous form. Along his chest and thighs the flames touched, caressing.
The blackness was himself, now; part of him, a segment of his mind, a portion of his body.
And he went on swiftly.
Toward his goal.
On the planet, Neeoorna, Adatha Za knew the salt taste of her tears. Her red lips were puffed by the teethmarks driven deeply into their softness. Her breasts rose swiftly.
The others stood about her, and their minds were blank.
At that moment they comprehended, but joy and awe were stronger than mere knowledge.
The black shadows winked once. They winked again, fleetingly.
Then they disappeared.
DR. WOODEN stood silent as Jonathan Morgan drew his hand from the switch that drove a bath of heat at the blocks of calcatryte set in their metallic cradles. The humming of motors stopped. The blackish screen in the background went silent, dead.
“Well,” said Dr. Wooden, straightening. “Hello.”
Jonathan sat down and put out a trembling hand, drew an open pack of cigarettes toward him.
“I’ve been far away,” he said slowly. “To the other side of the universe. Billions of miles away, and yet—in your own backyard.”
Dr. Wooden grinned and sat on the edge of the sandstone tabletop. He lighted a cigarette himself, saying, “Tell me.”
Jonathan told him. And then he said, “It seems understandable enough, really. Those powers I possess. What are they but an innate adaptability to environment. And isn’t that the true goal of Nature?
“The environment is what destroys, is what weakens, is what kills. Call it a blast furnace. Call it disease. Call it a clawing tiger. It is, nevertheless, our environment: temporary or permanent. To survive that, man must be immortal, in a physical sense. In the sense that he possesses in himself all the necesary attributes to enable him to overcome that environment. That way lies immortality.”
Dr. Wooden regarded the glowing tip of his cigarette. He said, “That’s clear enough. It is fantastic, but who knows what changes one million or two million years will bring in man. Lord knows, it brought a lot of changes on Earth itself! Now, about the flames—”
Jonathan crushed out his cigarette. “They were the emanations from the calcatryte. I realized that eventually. It stood to reason. It had to be something alien to a universe where light curves. Something that either ate up matter or made it invisible or opened a door for it to leak out somewhere, into nothingness.
“Calcatryte gives off straight light, so powerful that it eats through metal. It could as easily eat through dirt and rock, through the moon of a planet, through a planet itself. Through the universe, in short. In a universe based on curving light, that unbendable light was an anomaly. It ate up our universe, or started to.”
“Again, clear enough. It’s reasonable, and possible. But when you went into the shadows and passed through them—you emerged here in my laboratory. But my laboratory is billions upon billions of miles from Neeoorna.”
Jonathan grunted, “In terms of ordinary space, yes. I passed through hyperspace.”
“That’s a mathematical concept.”
“I know. But we—you have proved It exists. It has been proven mathematically.”
Dr. Wooden looked dubious. Jonathan picked up a pencil and pressed down with the point on a slip of graph paper.
“That black mark, that dot, is one-dimensional. Extend a line from that point to another dot. The line is also one-dimensional. Let us put the pencil on the line, supersede the line with the pencil. Since the pencil has three dimensions, so does the line—for the pencil is the line.
“Suppose an w-dimensional object. Supersede the pencil with the w-dimensional object and we have an w-dimensional line. It is an w-dimensional space of w-dimensional points, instead of our original definition of a line as a single dimensioned space of points set in a row.
“Ordinary space is called three-dimensional because it is occupied by three-dimensional things. Planes, for instance. But if we speak of lines of spheres or circles, we can easily step into the realm of w-dimensionality.
“The drawback is that we can’t see it. We can’t envision w-dimensionality.
“Consequently, we have always been intrigued by many-dimensionality because we can’t picture it to ourselves. But the calcatryte rays weren’t hindered by a lack of imagination. They just zoomed off into an w-dimensional space, and wound up near Neeoorna. They were lines, remember, straight lines. And lines can be w-dimensional.”
Dr. Wooden rubbed his chin and said, “Could be, could be. But how does hyperspace solve your problem?”
“A dot inside a circle can go outside that circle without crossing its circumference. Likewise, I could pass from the inside to the outside of a sphere without going through the surface of a four-dimensional object.
“Those calcatryte rays beamed out from your lab into hyperspace, passing through ordinary space without touching it, and appeared billions of miles away. When I entered the shadows, I followed their course.”
Dr. Wooden drew a deep breath, saying, “If I hadn’t seen you materialize out of thin air—” and broke off, laughing.
“Seeing does enter it, doesn’t it? But the attempts that were made to fight the shadows! Why were the attackers always destroyed? Unless—unless their weapons backfired on them—”
“That’s my thought. They were shooting three-dimensional objects at an w-dimensional space. The three-dimensional objects never got anywhere. They didn’t even leave their source. They expended their frightful energy right where they began.”
“Well,” muttered Dr. Wooden. “You could talk for hours and not prove anything.”
HE broke off, looking at Jonathan. He lifted a wooden mallet and held it out to him.
“Destroy it,” he said simply. “If it’s that much of a danger to the universe, it deserves obliteration.”
Jonathan put out his hand, brushed the mallet aside.
He bent over the table, setting both hands on it, partially supporting his weight.
The calcatryte in the metal cradles began to quiver as though made of soluble, moving liquid. Their veins ran into channels of color, red and green and blue and yellow. The blocks hazed over, writhing. The calcatryte was fading, bit by bit. Jonathan stood up. He looked worn, but his lips smiled.
“It’s done,” he whispered.
“You won’t stay?”
A smile came and dwelt on Jonathan’s lips.
“No,” he said. “No, I won’t stay. I am going back to Neeoorna, and then to Zarathza—to look at a sunrise coming up over the waters of the Jaralayan Sea.”
He went out, and the door closed behind him, softly.
Well, here it is. The Winter Issue. Time for another bout of ballots, blasts and battles. Open season on authors and fellow Visifans. Don’t spare the steel, guys and gals. When you've finished reading an issue, let’s have your reactions. Anything goes, so long as it is in good taste. Double-space your lines. One side of the page written on. Two page limit.
Here’s an item of interest. Scienti-fiction is really coming of age. FIGHT STORIES magazine is using it now. Scrap-Iron, a short Stf story by Larry Sternig, appeared in the Fall Issue. Coming of age? With the release of news about the German sun-mirror, rocket, rocket-planes, atom bombs, etc., it is of age. I’m wondering what will happen to science-fiction when the stories we publish in PLANET have become history instead of prediction. What will our authors write about then?
Coming back to our book, if the following three winners will drop a card indicating their choices of originals from the Summer Issue, their pics will be forwarded immediately.

P. O. Box 682,
Jamestown, North Dakota
Dear Editor:
It would appear that my opinions on the ultimate in the field of material velocity as published a couple of numbers back has evoked some disagreeing comment.
The theory advanced by Mr. Sigler is most interesting. I only regret that he did not go into the matter more thoroughly. It is most difficult to even attempt to judge the merit of the revolutionary theory advanced, on the basis of the material published, as the details of the thesis were completely lacking.
At this point, I wish to express my sincere appreciation of the fact that this extraordinary hypothesis, if I may use that word, on what, for lack of a better term, I shall call super velocity, was advanced in opposition to my more conservative views. While I cannot at this time agree with Mr. Sigler, I consider it a signal honor to have such a worthy adversary in this matter.
What I wrote about the highest attainable speed under theoretically idea conditions is a matter of record; I have nothing further to add on that subject at the present time. I think it is quite evident that my views of the issue in dispute were based primarily on the Lorentz-Fitzgerald Contraction theory, and the Special and General theories of Relativity by Einstein. In referring to the speed of light, I meant that the speed measured and calculated by Michealson. It is my understanding that this figure has been accepted by the world of science as approximately correct since that great pioneer in this field, Ole Romer, made his famed calculations on elapsed time across the Earth’s Orbit, based upon the observed and apparent motions of Jupiter’s satellites.
Dear Editor:
Admittedly, all measurements do not agree exactly, but when the tremendous speed of light and the limited terrestial distances over which it may be measured are considered, the narrow range of differences observed by Michealson and others are amazing in that they differ so little. Three hundred thousand kilometers per second is the generally accepted velocity, but in the more technical books, both on physics and radio engineering, the figure 299,820 kilometers per second is the accepted standard at this time. However, in the past, many widely accepted theories have had to be discarded, and at the present time it would be sheer folly to reject a theory simply because it is at variance with the commonly accepted standards of the so-called authoritative works on the subject.
Mr. Sigler’s suggestion that the speed, or velocity, of light may not be a constant has far-reaching implications, not only in the field of abstract science, as exemplified by Einstein, but also in the common and practical fields of radio, television, and to a limited extent, motion pictures, namely the technicolors.
The idea that Hertzian waves do not travel at the speed of light is of particular interest, as it raises the question of any other satisfactory explanation of resonance. Also, the phase relationship in AF and RF circuits is based on the speed of light basis, and seems to work out well in practice. But here again it is possible that other considerations apply. However, it would appear that any new thesis on radiations would have to take into account the known behavior of radio waves. What I mean by the above is the directional intensity patterns of transmitting stations, the phase shift of the Western Electric Doherty amplifier, and the whole field of frequency modulation, as well as usual RF behavior.
As to the known velocity of any radiation being in excess of that of light, I must admit that I have never heard of same. I assume the emancipations of radium is referred to, but this is not specifically stated. This in itself is very interesting.
All in all, it would seem that several fields of science and engineering will have to be completely revised if this seemingly grandiose theory on the velocity of electromagnetic radiations is accepted. If it can be shown that Hertzian waves and light waves travel at different speeds, this alone will completely alter the theory of radio, etc. As to the possibility of traveling faster than light, this of course is abstract physics at this time; in other words, strictly academic. But as applied to Hertzian waves, if this new theory covers known behavior better than the present theory, it is surely worthy of serious consideration. And perhaps from this, its abstract significance could be determined.
Since Mr. Sigler raised this issue, I think he should explain at least in some detail how he arrived at his conclusions. For all we know, his theory may be a scientific advance of the first magnitude, or it may be the wild imaginings of some overly enthusiastic screwball. How about some details on it, Mr. Sigler? And what do the rest of you fellows think about it? Any discussion ?
Sincerely,
Lewis Sherlock.

MASS PREDICTIONS

Thanks for printing my letter. You claimed you didn’t understand what I meant by that meteorite collapsing under its own weight. It is very simple; any great weight must be braced to hold up. In the story the rock could be supported at the cable contacts only and since it was not a solid mass in the true sense of the word would tend to break up under gravitational stress.
Now to the present issue. The cover is the usual type. Man, woman and enemy. Incidentally, doesn’t the artist read the story. The girl was supposed to be wearing shirt and pants. Ray Cummings’ story was pretty good. I am glad to have someone for a villain besides a banker. They always did get a lot of dirt they didn’t deserve. Mutiny was entertaining as it dealt with the human element which must always be taken into consideration.
The Last Monster was good but pathetic as he couldn’t make them see what he was. However, I think he could have found some way out of that difficulty. Drawing sketches, perhaps.
The Ringers are always ridiculous. Beer Trust Busters certainly was a novel application of Einstein’s theory. However, I doubt if a drunkard could work anything like that.
Battlefield in Black was entertaining, but it would have sounded more realistic if the enemy weapon had just been described as cancelling ether borne vibrations, instead of actually removing the ether. I would like to know how they built that timing device in pitchdarkness. Try building a small radio that way and avoid the soldering copper. Another thing, I would certainly like to have those instruments that enabled them to land in darkness from beyond the moon’s orbit.
The Bubble Divellcrs was pretty fair, too. It was certainly a relief from the other Hallmeyer yarns in which he was always running around in someone else’s body.
Formula for Conquest was a good short; while the letter section was better than usual. Not so many halfwits around this time.
I agree with Bob Lambert about not having any war stuff. I get enough of that elsewhere. By the way, has it occurred to anyone that our present hatred of the Axis would enable someone to escape the consequences of some crime by pretending the Axis did it. The public might swallow it unless there was some slip up.
Here is a little forecast of what I think the near future may be in the event of Interplanetary travel: 1980 World War III. 1981 Conquest of Moon. 1990 Mars Reached. 1992 Venus Explored. 1998 Colonies Planted on Venus and Mars. 2100 Fourth World War. 2160 Jovian Moons Colonized.
After this war Russian control over Europe grows until it culminates in war with the Western world. The former Axis nations stripped of their territory are forced to expand along with the United States to the nlanets. England, Fance and Russia are so busy playing power politics that they fail to obtain new colonies in time. Anger over this grows until World War IV flares into being. Because our interests happen to be the same, we go to war with Germany and Japan against our former allies. This war is mostly fought on Earth and leaves Europe a wreck. The Communistic regimq is crushed and
Russia become a Monarchy under a new dynasty. England becomes a semi-republic and is stripped of her overseas empire, sinking to a small island without much political influence.
May sound like hooey, but it is an attempt to use the past to forecast the future. In case of no Interplanetary travel, cannot say what the future will be.
Sincerely,
Edwin Sigler.
fiction instead of all the cute stuff. It doesn't matter too much who writes them if they’re good.
That’s all, I guess. Keep Planet coming and you’ve got one staunch supporter plunking down his 20c every three months. With a last despairing sigh, our hero sinks back into dark oblivion.
Sincerely,
Chad Oliver.
PRODIGAL RETURNS
1311 25th Street, Galveston, Texas
Dear Editor:
It has been many a long month since yours truly last sent an epistle winging merrily out into the great unknown in quest of dear old PS, and it seems that most of the other Visifans of yesteryear have likewise quietly folded their typewriters and stolen away into the night. But lo and behold—I’m back.
The particular cause—or excuse—for this letter is the long overdue return of Ray Cummings to your hallowed pages. Ray may not be what he used to be years ago, he may have a standard plot that he clings to with all the tenacity of a dying octopus, his style may evoke endless repetition—but Ray Cummings, by all the myriad gods of Lovecraft, can write/ He can and does write rings around most of vour writers without even approaching his superlative best. More Cummings, say I—especially a juicy novel of about fifty or sixty pages; which you could use more of anyhow.
To me, there were three really good stories in the Fall PLANET. The best, despite my passion for Cummings, was The Bubble Dwellers, by Ross Rocklynne. Hallmeyer returns-— somewhat different from what he used to be, it seemed to me. But Ross wove a powerful story here, with good characters rather than props. He can write, after all, when not pounding out tripe like Cosmic Yo-Yo, etc.
Cummings’ Juggernaut of Space comes next, very closely pursued by The Last Monster. (No pun.) The latter tale was really quite good— maybe Gardner F. Fox is a find.
The other stories simply were not in the running. In general there seems to be to much silly junk appearing; there is nothing more deadly than the unfunny funny story—and, dear editor, they are not amusing. I still remember with pleasure Brown’s The Star Mouse, but I have a very definite feeling that the ha-ha element should have begun and ended in PS with that story.
The where-have-I-seen-this-before cover is merely another episode in Planet’s eternal saga; not bad, not good. Ingels contributed two nice interior pix. I understand that Paul and Finlay are not available for artwork—but what happened to Hannes Box? Surely there is someone around who can still draw.
La Vizi romps on its merry way; the backbone of the magazine. Dr. Gardner gets the nod for the best letter, and second and third places go to G. Dallas.
A few suggestions, if I may. How about some longer stories — like Vassals of the Master World? Let’s cut the corn. How about an off-trail yarn by Clark Ashton Smith? And stories by Hamilton, Kuttner, Cummings, Ray Bradbury, etc. But, most important of all, give us rome stories with meat on 'em; some real science
VIZIGRAPH GAL
Columbus, Ohio
Dear Editor:
I have read two or three issues of PS and as an inexperienced reader, I find the Vizigraph far more entertaining than the stories. Some people expresses their opinions in such nice, idotic ways.
1.	Juggernaut of Space is O.K. But! (I quote) “She was clad in a thin, summer street dress. Her lush, lissome curves were gone so that it hung drably on her. The vivid artificial blonde hair was darkish at the roots; it fell in a tangled mass to her shoulders. Her makeup was gone; her lips pallid.” (Unquote) Well, brother, if I could look like the following illustrations of her in that condition, that’s the way I'll go around looking alia time. Illustrations don’t fit descriptions! But Ingels draws very well.
2.	Mutiny is O.K. Interesting.
3.	The Lost Monster. Maybe my concept of literature is strange, but I think this is one of the best stories in the lx>ok More, Mr. Fox. Ingels' illustration was super.
4.	Beer Trust Busters is a lotta story written around nothing. What’s the object?
5.	Battlefield In Black. I couldn’t get up enough interest to go beyond the first five pages. Maybe it was good.
6.	The Bubble Dwellers is another of the best. Nice drawings.
7.	Formula for Conquest is good. Professor Twilken was a quaint character.
After giving my much sought after opinion, I still say; Vizigraph entertains me most
Sincerely,
Ann Noe.
FOREIGN FAN
Dear Ed:
I read all science fiction one finds possible in a foreign state (Florida). I have just begun reading Ppanet Stories lately and I enjoy it very much.
Suppose we go to the letters first; Sgt. M. P. Adams and Doctor T. S. Gardner wrote the best letters in my opinion.
The cover was drawn and quartered by someone with a vivid imagination no doubt.
The Stories
No. 1. Juggernaut of Space. Rather well written and plotted; exciting to a certain extent
No. 2. The Bubble Dwellers. All right but slightly confusing in certain spots or incidents. How in heaven’s name, tell me, can one write 209 words on a scrap of paper 1 Vs inches square and still have enough space left over to put down the directions for operating a ‘telepathic transmitter’ ?
No. 3. The I^ast Monster. It was too, too, pathetic. I felt very sorry for “IRGI,” the monster. It was a good story, although it was sad.
Dear Editor:
Sincerely,
No. 4. Battle in Black. Too confusing for a simple mind It was rather boring, but the love wasn’t so bad; that’s what I like about some stories.
No. 5 Beer Trust Busters. ^ Humorous. Well plotted and written, in my opinion.
No. 6. Formula for Conquest. The ‘Kelecyrine’ capsules were probably nothing but water, carbon dioxide or carbon tetrachloride It will da

Q.K.—MORE VARIETY 13618 Cedar Grove Detroit 5, Michigan
Congratulations for publishing a really different story in the latest Planet. I am referring to The Last Monster by Gardner Fox. This was one of the most interesting stories Planet has published in a good many issues. The underlying idea and the plot were so different from your usual run of stories as to make quite a pleasant contrast with the rest of the magazine. Hiding under that mediocre title was one of the neatest bits of psychology to appear in a mag. A little variety like this is what Plant needs, if you want your mag to keep on the upgrade. Whatever happened to Leigh Brackett’s "off-trail” series? They were really good.
I read with interest Dr. Gardner's letter in the
Vizigraph. Especially interesting was the first part of the letter. I agree with him wholeheartedly; Planet publishes a different type of story. An excellent example of your type of fiction is to be found in Ross Rocklynne's The Bubble Dwellers in the current issue. Here is a well written, yet scientific, fast-moving adven-true story. The characterization and description were well handled, and the action was properly subordinated to the idea behind the story. There were enough thought-provoking ideas to keep one's interest aroused throughout the whole story. It probably will not remain in my memory as long as The Last Monster, but I enjoyed it. I think what impressed me most was the almost machine-like precision of the writing.
Speaking of machine-like precision, I think that this is the one fact that makes Planet just a little different from the other Stf mags. Issue after issue, and story after story are alike in uniformity. I’m glad to say that I think that this uniformity is of a high quality. However, in attaining this level of material, it seems to me that you have lost something in the process. I think that this something is originality. While it is true that most of the stories are well written, they are all more or less along the same general lines of thought and plot. Even a very well written story will become boring if the reader has the feeling ahat he's read it a dozen times when he reaches the 4th or 5th page. I’ll take Cummings' latest story in Planet as an example. There was nothing wrong with Juggernaut of Space, except that it was exceptionally dull and uninteresting. I can’t blame this on any particular reason except that it was basis of an idea that is exceedingly old.
The Vizigraph was not so bad as usual, having a few sensible letters to brighten things up. The best letters were: (1) Dr. Gardner, (2) Edwin Sigler, (3) Sgt. Adams.
Sincerely,
Henry Elsner, Jr.
THE SUMMING UP
94 Lincoln St Brighton 35, Mass.
Dear Editor:
I’m really going to enjoy writing this letter.
Having obtained the latest issue of Planet, I note that it is Vol. II, No. 12. Therefore, thought I, why not reminisce a bit? It certainly is pleasant to review my back files of PS, rereading my favorite yarns and chuckling over the Vizigraph. It is six years since the mag's inception, and those years were studded with yarns acclaimed by some as classics, and many which were penned as hash. But all in all, I think Planet did very well to even keep going in the everchanging field of science-fiction.
Here are the yarns which, in my estimation, are the most outstanding.
1.	Vassals of the Master-World, by Cavelo Binder. Over and above the best story Planet has ever published.
2.	The Cosmic Juggernaut, by John Russell Vearn.
3.	Cave-Dwellers of Saturn, by John Wiggin. One of the fastest-moving yarns I have ever read.
4.	The Ultimate-Salient, by Nelson S. Bond.
5.	Twilight of the Tenth World, by Thornton Ayre.
6.	Man of the Stars, by Sam Moskowitz.
7.	The Last Martian, by Raymond Van Hou-ten.
8.	Task to Lahr, by Ross Rocklynne. The best of the unforgettable Hallmeyer series.
9.	Prey of the Space-Falcon, by Wilbur S. Peacock.
10.	The Star Guardsman, by Albert De Pina.
11.	Invaders of the Forbidden Moon, by Raymond Z. Gallun.
12.	Revolt on the Earth Star, by Earl Selwyn.
13.	Buccaneer of the Star Seas, by Ed Earl Repp.
14.	One Thousand Miles Below, by Eardo Bins-lev.
15.	Black Friar of the Flame, by Isaac Asi-
nov.
Runners up: World of Mockery, Washowitz. Colossus of Chaos, Bond. Alcatraz of the Star-ways, Hasse and Depina; Expedition to Pluto, Pratt and Manning; and Minions of the Crystal Sphere, Depina.
Best cover: Paul's for Binder’s “Vassalo.”
Best inside pic: Paul’s for "Outpost on So.”
Best all around issue: Fall, 1943. (Incidentally, the swell cover by Rozen almost beat out Paul for first.)
Most consistently good author: Nelson S. Bond.
I won’t bother commenting on the current PLANET, as my allotted two pages, double spaced, is almost gone. But I must thank you for the return of Sydney Hallmeyer and Roy Cummings.
Bill Terrio.
BALLOTS, BABES AND BLASTS
1247 Denver Blvd., San Antonio, Texas.
Dear Editor:
^ Again I get the old mill into gear (low) and sit down to let the genius pour forth.
First of all and now, an idea! Yeh, I think it is a honey. Most of us fans know that you can't print all of the letters you get, so, why is it not possible to send us a small card to acknowledge them? Just a little hickey like this:
Letter in (1) Hand, (2) Wastebasket, (3) Fire.
To you (1) Thanks, (2) Nuts, (3) The Same.
Write again (1) Soon, (2) Never, (3) At your own RISK.
I know most of the fans would like this as it would show that somebody read our words before they were assigned to the limbo of the wastebasket, at least. (I’ll even enclose a penny for the postcard.) See what the rest think of it.
Now comes the fun. I’m going to operate on the Fall issue. Nurse the antiseptic and the deodorant.
You really have a story and I do mean a STORY in the novelet The Last Monster by Fox. That folks is not only the best in the issue, but it even beat the Red Witch of Mercury all hollow. Only two minor weaknesses, and that is something when I am so well satisfied; in fact, no deodorant this story. These weak spots were the correction of Mussdorf, and being STFiction, I’ll even believe this un-human act, and the description of Irgi. He was, both from the text and the pics, akin in form to the Earthly octopus, yet he bathed his chest and torso in the cobalt radiance, and any school boy knows that a chest is something an octopus ain’t got one of.
Deodorant, nurse. Here is the story most deserving of the “Stinkremover,” particularly since Ross Rocklynne slipped so badly on it. The Bubble Dwellers was the one. Honestly, I put it among all of the rest of my PS’s, and all of the covers turned to an even mal-de-mer green, but quick. All I ask, Ross, is that you turn out your usual good work and I’ll forgive, but not forget. ""
Now for the rest of the stories.
The Last Monster	 50%
Battlefield in Black	20%
Beer-Trust Busters	* 12%
Formula for Conquest	6%
Mutiny 	 5%
Juggernaut of Space	 4%
Bubble Dwellers	 3%
100%
Vizigraph . . . 85% of past Vizigraphs Sigler says that a .22 short has more punch than any air rifle made. Well, did he ever see a Benjamin, with about 20 strokes in the chamber? I did, and let me tell him that I have seen one throw a .22 slug through 4" of pine at 25' distance. Try that on your Remington with 22 shorts and then don’t say a word.
On the other hand, I agree with you on the theory of inertial lag, warped space and the idea that the velocity of light is a limit to speed of travel and communication. I disagree with you when you say that the methods used to measure the speed of light are no proof at all. To my way of thinking they are quite good, within 10%, and that is close enough for our purposes. Also, the spectrum shift. Have you ever heard of Doopler’s principle? And have you ever heard a train whistle as it approached you? That is the basis of spectrum shift, you know.
I must be in a good mood todav for I’m even agreeing with the “doddering Ancient,” Gerry Williams, in the need for curvacious females in space. Mankind isn’t that senile yet. After all,
what else is worth fighting for? Ideals, mebbe;
wealth, mebbe; gals, YES!
Sincerely,
Vernon W. Cooper.

Dear Editor:
In my opinion P.S. has been in a rut for the past year or so. For one thing, the stories are becoming much too generalized. Actually, they're not science-fiction anymore. For the most part, you’re featuring westerns and detective yarns under a thin futuristic veneer. Of course, there are exceptions, notably Depina’s fine stories and Leigh Brackett’s superb fantasies.
Another sore spot is your utterly putrid artwork. In the past you featured such fine artists as Frank R. Paul, but lately you’ve been using the Fiction House Cartoonists. Doolin and Anderson are prime examples of this. The illustrations are utterly devoid of shadowing of any sort.
The Vizigraph is also degenerating. The letters are becoming boring. There are few variations of theme. They’re divided into two classes: (1) A simple rating of stories. (2) Psuedo-humorous epistles written primarily to see the author’s name in print. There hasn’t been a good discussion for months.
I have several suggestions to make for the future. For one thing, add some departments for the benefit of the active fan, such as a Fanzine Review Column, a department of fanzine reprints. This would build up the lagging reader interest. Another is to feature stories concerning sociology, psychology, etc. Instead of the physical sciences all the time, a 50-50 intermingling of the two classes would be enjoyable.
A special word of praise for Gardner F. Fox’s fine story The Last Monster. It was the beet story you’ve published for some time. The ironic ending was really terrific. This is the type of yarn you can really get your teeth into. More of the same please
Sincerely,
Georgr R Fox.
SCANTIES?
3100 Ocean Parkway,
Brooklyn 24, N. Y.
Dear Editor:
After having read several issues of Planet Stories, I’ve finally gotten around to writing. The last copy I read was part good, part lousy.
I liked the cover. Although most of the Vizigraph writers disagree, I prefer pictures of underclothed females. The less clothes, the better.
My rating on the stories are as follows:
1.	The Last Monster—Sounds like satire, something pathetic.
2.	Juggernaut of Space—Old plot, presented
in exciting manner.
3.	Mutiny—Battlefield in Black—Both good.
5.	Formula for Conquest—not bad.
6.	Beer-Trust Busters—Funny in a queer sort of way.
7.	The Bubble Dwellers—Terrible. Plot just crawled along.
Special praise to your policy of printing the gripes as well as the compliments in the Vizigraph. I’m sure the other readers feel the same way about this.
Sincerely,
Alan Goldman.

FIERY FEM FAN
1384 Palace Ave., St. Paul, Minn.
Dear Editor :
Tremblingly, I take a tighter grip on my typewriter to brave the wrath of the gods with my first fan letter. Yes, good old P.S. has finally roped me into it!
Here’s how I’d rate the stories:
1.	The Last Monster—the idea of a benevolent monster was rather clever.
2.	The Bubble Dwellers and Juggernaut of Space—both of them were well written and fast
moving.
3.	Formula for Conquest—the idea of having a Martian hero was kind of cute, but how could the formula make the Plutonians more intelligent if it merely speeded up evolution? Did they work it backwards or something?
4.	Beer-Trust Busters—the plot was corny, but the excellent writing made up for that.
5.	Mutiny and Battlefield in Black—well, at least they were well written.
Now for the Vizigraph:
I’d rate Dr. Gardner first because it's nice to hear from someone who really knows about science, instead of a lot of antognistic quacks who think they do.
If Edwin Sigler can’t understand the stories, he’d better wait until he reaches the age where he can (say twelve or so). Besides, if he dislikes P.S. that much, why does he buy it?
Sincerely,
Evelyn L. Vogt.
WANNA FIGHT?
4711 Verdun Ave., Verdun, Quebec.
Dear Editor:
I thought I’d have a little argument with someone in the Vizigraph. But durn the luck, there’s no one to argue with. Everyone seems to agree pretty well on the story rating, and the one point about mental telepathy was snaffled by ye editor, and quite successfully disposed of.
The cover was one of the best I’ve seen. It showed a beautiful maid and a rugged hero. In the background, there was plenty of action. And to top it off, we have some futuristic machinery, all done in just the right coloring. Surely everyone is satisfied with this one, even the “Red Witch,” Virginia Shawl.
Now to the meaty section. Here are my ratings as far as the stories go.
1.	Juggernaut of Space. Swell story, good plot. I liked the way it was written. Sounded like good old pre-war stock. But as usual I have a kick. I don’t understand how a planet, going at such speed, in an erratic course, could keep its atmosphere and not burn up?
2.	The Bubble Dwellers. I liked this one a lot, but don’t ask me why; I just liked it. Zondat was sure a super dope. He could rule a whole planet and keep its people under his will, yet he stayed on a tortured planet that was slowly leading him up to a nervous breakdown. Ain’t some people silly?
3.	Mutiny. This was well written. ^ Just when I thought Rawson was finished, zowie, he turns up again.
4.	There was a tie between The Last Monster and Formula for Conquest. They were both well written and held my interest throughout. Irgi was painted so convincingly that, believe it or not, I really felt sorry for him.
5.	Battlefield in Black had its good points, but it also had its bad ones. There were no red blooded action scenes to speak of. The enemy in space was destroyed without showing one spark of fight. It all seemed too easy, as though anyone with the same equipment could have done just as good a job as “Mac.”’ Why didn’t Georgey-boy let the enemy win a few more rounds? It certainly would have given the story a bit more interest.
Sincerely,
Gerry Williams.
SHOCKING NEWS
730 S. California, Camden, Arkansas.
Dear Editor:
What I am about to disclose will probably come as a great shock to a great many of your readers, but there is at least one state in the union where you can openly walk up to a newsstand and in a loud clear voice ask for Planet Stories without fear of the law or your fellow man. Its perfectly legal to buy and sell it in Arkansas. The only trouble is that you have to join the rush if you want a copy. But this is a friendly place, and if you get there too late one of your friends will loan you his copy in a day or two.
I. won’t try to rate the stories, I liked them all. But I do have one request to make. Please, let’s have a real honest to goodness BEM on the cover once in a while. Some of the late-comers have never viewed a sure-enough oldtimer. Surely, in some out of the way corner, on on* of the planets, there is at least one left

YIPES—A GRIPE
811 Mich. Ave., Saint Cloud, Fla.
Dear Editor:
I have just finished reading the Fall issue of Planet, and now I feel as if I have the right to type this little note.
The contents of the Fall Planet varied from bad—to worse. Ingels* illustratoin for Juggernaut of Space was good, and it’s a shame the novel itself was so poor. The job that Doolin did for Mutiny was certainly bad. Didn’t he know that there were supposed to be 61 crewmen on the ship? Much too small, really. The “action” expressed by the picture is also nil. But, heck, the story was no good anyway.
The cover was good, though the color was a bit of a shock. The hero, especially. Red Tee shirt, robin's egg blue shorts, and green long-handled underwear. O’ well. Also, the gun is supposed to shoot an explosive bullet, not a ray; and what does the girl want her left foot shot off for?
I guess that the only good story in the issue was The Bubble Dwellers. There were two nice letters, one by Edwin Sigler and the other, of course, by Dr. Gardner.
Hoping for a better mag next time.
Sincerely,
Norman A. Ruggles.

SUGGESTION MAN
264 East Main Street, Marlboro, Mass.
Just finished reading your Fall issue of Planet Stories and for my money it was three hours of swell reading. I read this magazine as often as I can, but not as often as I would like to.
To begin, I shall give you my opinion of your Fall issue. My favorite issue, or I should say story, was The Last Monster. Imagine, feeling sorry for an ugly creature like this, but I did (nonetheless. The tsory shows how “little” we are at times, too, in real life through our own ignorance. Battlefield in Black is a real “future” story. Congratulations to Mr. Whittington. Jug-geraiit of Space was also good, but a little long-winded Mutiny is a plot as old as the hills but dressed up fairly well. Formula for Conquest could have been terrific with a little more story to it.
I fully agree with the Editor on these fans that have a lot to write and criticize and NOTHING to SAY.
One thing I would like to suggest is that you bring out future sports in your stories. When our hero is through beating up the bad villain what does he do for fun?
I think it is a fine idea to set aside a corner in a magazine for public opinions and suggestions. It brings the reader so much closer to the publishers and whenever he picks up a magazine of yours he does so with the feeling that somehow he has helped out a little. It gives one the idea that all the heads of the book are not just fat pompous button pushers without any emotion, but really human and just as interested in the fans as we are in the publishers.
May I take time out to compliment Dr. Thomas S. Gardner on his extremely interesting letter.
' When so learned a man can “talk” to publishers in their own language and give out with a few sound points and theories, too, he’s okay for my money. I found his letter very teaching; I hope you will print more like his, instead of this “I don’t like dis; I like dat” stuff.
Sincerely,
Marcel E. Dunn.
IMPROVED PLANET
119 Woodland Ave., Coatesville, Pa.
Dear Editor:
I’m all for Mason’s idea of a Vizigraph supplement, but he should be sure to get those letters with ideas in them. Being conveniently close to Phila., I hope to be able to secure some of the issues.
Having bought Planet for a year, I’m beginning to see some improvement. The covers remain cheap only because of the repeated hero, dame, and BEM theme. With the stories, you at least have a good one every issue. As for the interior art work, Clyne is your best. The Vizigraph is the best letter dept. I’ve seen yet!
Sincerely,
Howard G. Allen, 3rd.
NO SLAMS
414 West 44th Streef, New York 18, N. Y.
Dear Editor:
First, for the inevitable:
1. The Last Monster, by G. F. Fox. This isn’t
the best benevolent monster story I have read, but it is good
2.	Beer-Trust Busters, by A. R. Stuart. Nutty as the proverbial fruitcake I liked “dastardly Dudley Drake.”
3.	The Bubble Dwellers, by Ross Rocklynne. After this I couldn’t make up my mind, and I
have decided not to slam writers too much (this time).
Now for the letter section. Dr. Gardner gets my first vote, although I don’t think he is too interested in receiving a pinup. Next comes Sgt. Adams, the s-f neophyte.
Sincerely,
Mel Eneman.
AFTER MUCH CUTTING
1303 Mystery St., New Orleans 19, La.
Dear Editor:
Unbelievable as it seems, Juggernaut of Space, by Cummings, of all people, gets first place! Really, I’m as surprised as you are.
The Bubble Dwellers.
The Last Monster. Sort of pathetic. I felt sorry for Irgi.
Battlefield in Black.
Mutiny.
Formula for Conquest. You wondering, too? Beer-Trust Busters. The things that get by as stf these days! I give up.

Dear Editor:
So, Cummings is back. I’ve heard a lot about this guy. Either a fan loves him or loathes him. Most of them seem to be of the latter opinion and I can’t wait to see the reaction to the tale he has in this issue. Personally I liked it, and would like very much to see more of Cummings.
Bubble Dwellers was about the best story in the issue. Yet, it was only fair. The Last Monster was okay, too. Maybe I should have rated it above the novels. Mutiny was a swell short. Formula for Conquest was just pure formula. Too much in Beer-Trust Busters that didn’t mean anything. Let’s just skip Battlefield in Black.
Now for the Vizigraph. Let’s give Virginia Shawl first place. She got down to the point, told what she liked and what she didn’t like and that was all. Dallas gets second place, mainly because he mentioned my letter. I don’t know who should have third.
Sincerely,
Millard Grimes.

NONSENSE
Dickinson, N. Dak.
Enough, I say, enough! You’ve jarred me loose from my self-satisfied complacency again. I've been sitting, quietly reading Planet Stories. I even sojourned into the basement and drug out some others to reread. But this present issue did it. In the Viz, I noticed references to various stories quite unfamiliar to me, time after time. Could it be? It is. I have missed the Spring issue! What’s the excuse? I know people hate to mention North Dakota in the upper circles. I try to avoid the subject myself, a helluvan excuse not to don’t say I just didn’t get it stand every day.
Or could it be that you have thought to stop the voice of truth from ringing out in the Viz by slipping issues by me? I repeat, enough of this foul muzzling.
I wander through the Viz in search of old familiar signatures. Where are Lesser, Oliver, Chidsey, Heiner, Hetschel, Karden, and the rest?
But, to pass on to pleasant subjects. Namely, the cover. Just to make a best seller out of P.S., why don’t you have a cover with a girl victim, a girl hero, and instead of a BEM, a girl villain, take for instance the Red Witch? Add much more joy and life to the situation.
Besides, that idea of the girl climbing the rope ladder while the hero holds off various forms of BEMs is getting monotonous. Remember the issue of May, 1943? Take a look, and you see: one girl going up ladder. One hero holding off several beasts. Then look at Summer, ’45. One girl going up one ladder. One hero, with two monsters in the picture. Can we look for this again in ’47?
And now, back to the thing that makes people wonder, the Viz. First, half of the letters managed to slam E. F. Buchanon while reminding you that the battle was outlawed. Don’t get me wrong, you guys, but let’s drop the subject, trample it, and bury it with that pack of Camels you got the other day. Out with the gas coupons and the sugar. Then, when we’ve all got gray hair, and want to cause a stir in the world, dig it up and model letters after it. Until then,’ though, how about really outlawing it? There’s plenty of other people to start a fight with. In fact, I’ll do it. I'M A REPUBLICAN/ Now gnaw on that for a while. Also the subject of dames and their clothing seems to be getting warm. Slap that one around for a while. I love those covers, but seriously, after buying one, I always stick it in an inner pocket and try to sneak home before some of my friends catch me. They love the covers, too, but after a while they look inside to see if there's any more of the same. Then they discover the horrible truth. It is one of those magazines. People get so they run if you glare at them, once they know you read that stuff.
What’s the answer on that “any subscriptions’' question ?
Life is getting so dull in the Viz. Many sharp remarks^ but nobody has the courage to sling any vitriol back. No notices of fans killed in mysterious bombings. No editors mutilated bodies found hanging from trees, or rockets either.
Well, tKat’s about enough, if you’ve stood it
this long. I'll be seeing you again though, so keep the back door open.
S incerely,
Guy Trucano, Jr.

Dear Editor:
Once again I sit myself down with a typewriter before me, to give you my reaction to the latest issue of Planet Stories.
It was while I was in St. Louis on a short business trip that I spied the Fall issue on the newsstands. The first thing I knew, I was arguing with myself whether or not I should get my copy there or wait until I got back home. I knew I would probably get a St. Louis fan’s copy, but the temptation was too great to resist. So I proudly walked over to the stand, grabbed my copy, and left the building by the front door.
I hastened to my hotel room where I could read in peace and quiet I didn’t leave until I had finished the whole mag, it was so interesting. Nice cover, too. It sure was beautiful. No matter how much the other fellows gripe about the covers, I still like them.
As for the stories: Rocklynne takes first place with The Bubble Dwellers. And naturally, Cummings comes in for a close second with his Juggernaut of Space. I have one gripe concerning these two stories, they were not long enough. These stories could have easily been written into super novels. Rocklynne and Cummings have the ability to do so. Now I ask. Why didn’t they? All the stories this issue were up to par except Stuart's Beer-Trust Busters. Apologies to Stuart, but his story just didn’t appeal to me. I managed to drag myself through it, but that’s all I can say for it.
Doolin’s illustration for The Bubble Dwellers takes first place beyond a doubt. The pic on page 94 (Who drew it? Doolin?) comes in second, and the rest were all good, too.
So marching along, we finally reach the Vizi-graph. Every letter in this issue was very interesting. Even mine. By the way. what progress is S. Mason making with his supplement?
Just when I have perfected a rocket fuel and started designs on a rocket ship capable of interplanetary travel, somebody like Dallas has to come up with teleportation— Oh, the futility of it all!
Sincerely,
Gerald Mahsman.
MORE ACCUMULATED STEAM

Dear Editor:
Pubbing my letter was a rude jolt. I merely sent it in to let off accumulated steam. But this time it’s different
Thou shoudst be banished to the lowest of the hyperberean caverns. Why? Because you cut TWO whole pages out of the Vizi. The nerve. You have, sir, in Planet, the best readers column in any pulp. The Vizi contains an unusual amount of science, but that’s all for the better. It seems a lot of people are sending in suggests telling the Eds how to fixa da mag. Sometimes they’re helpful, in others. . . . HeH.
Now to my individual comments.
Happy clinic: If you want so much action, why don’t you buy some of those Westerns you
were talking about. I’ll agree with you on the science angle, however, if that makes you happy.
Everet C. Marshall: Does anybody know why they buy PS?
Edwin Sigler: As for the monetary value of Hg (mercury, to the unlearned), don’t you think that the asteroid belt will yield more of that element, thus lowering the cost per pound?
Fred Goldberg: How dare you, suh! The BEM is an age-long institution with the s-fan, and you go mauling it up. Shame on youl
R. J. Gaulin: Look who’s talking about cluttering up the Vizi.
Dr. Gardner: Comment on UHF interesting. Good way to put sensitive instruments on under-water craft out of kilter, maybe. Why don’t you like the Ringers?
Dear me, that covers the Vizi in a crude way. Or maybe I shud cover myself up and leave.

R. J. Gaulin.
SHAKESPEARE AND STF
Ripley, Tenn.
Route 1
Dear Editor:
To begin somewhat abruptly, I wish to question the following statement by A1 Weinstein in the summer Planet: “No sf classic, no matter how great, can ever hope to compete with Shakespeare’s work or Kipling or a million others.”
This you state, Mr. Weinstein, with such dogmatic certainty that one is at first led to agree with you. But let us consider this for a moment. Why should there be a limitation to the powers of stf? There is no reason, I assure you.
Greatness of an author’s work is judged by what the majority think, and not by a minority like fandom. Therefore, while Kipling’s work is considered classic for one reason, we regard Stanley Weinbaum with respect for another. The attraction of Kipling lies chiefly in his local-color stories of India and the English army stationed there. I ha_ve nothing against local-color itself; it is local-color of India that is particularly obnoxious to me. Weinbaum’s “The New Adam” in such a true picturization of what every fan imagines himself that it will always remain in every real fan’s memory.
To further disprove him, I ask you to consider Edgar A. Poe’s work. Did he not write stf? There is no doubt in my mind of his superiority to Kipling. For directness of narration and forcefulness of expression Poe dwarfs Kipling into puerility.
And then what about H. G. Wells. And G- K. Chesterton, who wrote “The Man Who Was Thursday"? It seems that they compare quite favorable with the “name” authors.
I am not disputing Shakespeare’s greatness. I merely wish to point out a facet of his works with which the youthful Weinstein seems not to be familiar. Shakespeare injected the element of fantasy into many of his plays. Remember “King Lear” and “A Midsummer Night's Dream ” just to mention a few.
Merritt and Lovecraft, while not well-known because of their limited field, had imagination and descriptive powers that few men possess. Do you think that Kipling could have written “The Moon Pool” or “The Metal Monster” any more than I could? And would Merritt have stooped to such tripe as “Jungle Book”?
In your rash assumption, Weinstein, your criterion is the pulp magazine. I agree that It
isn’t likely that a story of lasting merit will be published in a pulp magazine where the main object is to give a few hours of entertainment; but give some of our authors free rein and see what they can produce-
Yours truly,
Lionel Innman.

Dear Editor:
“Shaw,” said the Bug-Eyed-Monster, “your time has cornel”
Now, it’s long been a question for hot debate in fan circles just what an avid stf reader would do if actually confronted with a horrible creature from another world. Some say he’d be more surprised than Mr. Average Man; others hold that he’d take it right in his stride. But at that precise moment it ceased to be a question any longer. Frankly, I was so startled I couldn’t think straight. (No comments, chum). After a terrific effort to compose myself, I finally gulped hard several times and came up with a halting, “H-h-huh?”
The BEM came closer and showed its teeth. I almost passed out. “I’m sorry to do this to you, Shaw,” it growled. “You ain’t such a bad guy when you come right down to it. But you were one of the first Vizifans to complain about the covers on Planet Stories and ask that they be changed. So you’ve gotta take your medicine along with the rest of the jerks.”
By this time I could at least talk straight again. Talking is an ability I never could lose for very long, and I saw tiiat this time my life was going to depend on how well I exercised my vocal cords. “But that was months—years— ago!” I protested. “I haven’t written to PS at all for a long time now. Certainly . .
“Don’t argue with me 1” snapped the huge, green-skinned beast. “You admit you did write letters like that. And after you stopped, someone else took it up. There was always some dumb goon writing in to yell about the monster, girl, and hero on the cover. Finally Peacock decided to have a cover without them—and look what happened 1”
' “Now wait a minute!” I said angrily. “I may not write to PS any more, but I always buy it And I’ve never seen a cover without the ‘Infernal Triangle’ on it. You’re off the beam somewhere!”
“Look,” said the Monster, talking slowly as if explaining to a small child, “you don’t understand at all. See this belt I’m wearing? It’s a time machine. I came back from twenty years in the future—it took that long for all you yaps to convince Editor Peacock he ought to try just one cover without any BEMs on it. He did, and the mag lost so many regular customers that the big shots at Fiction House decided to discontinue it. And since the artists didn’t need us monsters to pose for them any more, we were all thrown out of work. Naturally nobody would hire us for any ordinary jobs. It looked as if we’d all starve to death.^ Then I borrowed this time-belt from a mad scientist who also used to appear on PS covers once in a while and came back to bump off all the letter-hacks that ever complained about us poor monsters on the covers. This way, none of you will ever write those insulting things, and the entire future will be changed. And you, Larry Shaw, are going to be the first one to go!”
Dear Editor:
complimentary adjectives.


“N-n-now look,” I stuttered, “let’s talk this over. It won’t do you any good to kill the fans. There will always be others, and they’ll always write the same kind of letters. I'll tell you w-what. You let me live, and I’ll make it my sworn duty to see that the covers on PS continue to show a Bug-Eyed-Monster every time. I’ll persuade Peacock never to change them. I’ll write to the Vizi and tell the fans, too. I’ll argue them out of their prejudices. I’ll start a campaign for bigger and better monsters. I’ll—I’ll——
I'll ...”
The BEM scratched his quadruple-chin reflectively. “Well,” he rumbled, “maybe it’s worth a try. Okay, Shaw, I’ll take a chance on you. But you’d better do a doggone good job. Remember, I still have the time-belt, in case the fans keep on writing those complaints. And it won’t take long when I get back to the future to see if they ever changed their tune or not. So it’s up to you and the others now, Shawl Heaven help you if they don’t see the light 1”
And with that, the thing gnashed its foot-long fangs, flicked a button on the weird-looking belt, and vanished into nothingness.
That happened several hours ago, and I've just recovered enough control of myself to sit down and write this letter. It speaks for itself, I think. Read it and take heed, fans. Tear it out and paste it inside your hats. Get extra copies and pin them up on the wall where you’ll see them every morning as soon as you wake up. Remember, your lives depend on whether you have sense enough to heed the warning or not!
And after all, there’s nothing really so bad about Bug-Eyed-Monsters, is there now?
Desperately yours,
Larry Shaw.
A BUCHANON FAN?

Cloquet, Minnesota.
Dear Wilbur:
It’s been a good many issues since I last wrote to the Vizigraph, and a good many issues since I’ve read a copy of Planet through; I’ve changed my viewpoint on fandom and letterhacking a bit during that time, and my opinion of the Spring Planet is quite a bit different from what it would have been then. For one thing, I no longer accept scien-fiction because it is science-fiction; now, it must have something besides a plot with scientific accessories, because there are so many other types of literature to read, much more entertaining than a poorly written s-f tale, that the waste of time to read one is appalling.
The cover on the Spring issue, of course, is inexcusable. It followed the ancient formula of hero-heroine-monsters, and in addition, it was abominably painted, so fuzzy as to be almost illegible, and slightly sickening. Several of the interior illustrations were striking, and the trick of enclosing small cuts within the story is rather interesting, if they’re well drawn.
The best story in the issue, from my rather peculiar critical viewpoint, was De Pina’s Silver Plague. It was uneven, almost spotty, in its action; it had no exceptional characters, or no well-expressed sociological profundities to hide its essential emptiness; but it did have two incidents—Varon’s meeting with Fcrmin, and Varon in the pleasure palace—that rank with anything similar that science-fiction has as yet produced. They are but incidents, but the smoothly flowing description that occasionally seems out of place in De Pina’s stuff, combines evenly with characterization and conversation, to form something that lives. If De Pina had a guiding hand to express the larger framework of the story, something memorable might yet come from his pen.
Sincerely,
Ray A. Karden.
ORCHIDS TO ADAMS!

Just five minutes ago I thought I was being plagiarized. Just 300 (now 450) short seconds ago my mind tripped rapidly over law suits and stuff. The reason is all too simple. My opening lines had actually been set in type. Under another name I presumed. But no—out of the fogginess of my vision rose the name which I love best in the world, my own. I will have to agree with the defunct Mr. Buchanon that it is a thrill to see one’s personal symbol made permanent by the linotype. Tis but to dream.
Where oh where has Bergey gone—where the hell is he? That tripe that Parkhurst smears on canvas is faintly odoriferous. Can’t you buy off his contract? And that glamorous, shapely, muscle-bound Amazon complacently tearing some chains off the wall is a sloppy horror. But come, let us revere the dead. . . .
Once again that “rakish freebooter” of the spaceways, whose name strikes terror to the hearts of various vegetables, the “Sandhound” occupies precious space in Planet. Avaunt thou oh clumsily-written fool ne’er more to return. What has happened to Rocklynne?
Now to the one and only L.B. How is it that She (with a capital S) can consistently turn out the finest stuff in the mag. issue after issue. Miss Brackett has lifted her stories above the others by subduing the simple (unwanted) adventure and injecting social themes into her epics. She doesn’t use DePina’s complicated, scrabbled settings. She writes simply and from the heart.
beautiful, I am running out of
Vandals Of the Void started out swell and ended in a hodgepodge of interspatial imperialism.
Joe Carson's Weapon—A delicious bit of satire. The letter to the editor was a composite of all letters to editors. The fantastic, ridiculous and entirely silly story was better to read than 99/100ths of the serious hack spilling daily from hundreds of typewriters. A gem Mr. Adams.
By the way, the Rubimor I was complimenting in my letter was the one done for Warrior of Two Worlds. A beautiful hunk of artwork, even comparable (highly) with Finlay’s best.
I do not mention the other stories (?) because they would not be worth the effort used. The space given to Gifford could be used to better advantage.
Dear “disgusted bystander”
It is not necessary to read only STF to be a judge of good writing. It is my contention that the average reader knows what he likes. They are paying for the mag. and even if the writer is a poor miserable down-trodden slob, even if he does sweat over a hot typewriter all day, they have a right to pan his work if they dislike it. (Pan it, yes, technically criticize, no. Ed.)
Time to close up shop. So long.
P.S. Mr. DePina take a hint from Mark Twain and don’t get so involved.
Sincerely,
Richard Rosen.

lake the case of John Smith, average American:
For over three years now, he’s been buying War Bonds. Putting away a good chunk of his earnings, regularly.
He's accumulating money.
Now suppose everybody in the Payroll Plan does what John Smith is doing. Suppose you multiply John Smith by 26 million.
What do you get?
Why—you get a whole country that’s just like John Smith! A solid, strong, healthy, prosperous America where everybody can work and earn and live in peace and comfort when this war is done.
For a country can't help being, as a whole, just what its people are individually!
If enough John Smiths are sound their country’s got to be!
The kind of future that America will have—that you and your family will have—is in your hands.
Right now, you have a grip on a wonderful future. Don’t let loose of it for a second.
