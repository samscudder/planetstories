            <h1>Captives of the Weir-Wind</h1>
            <h2>By Ross Rocklynne</h2>
            <h3>The girl held all the trumps, and Julian Darnay found himself in her power, being swept on a terror-flight through the void. Their objective—if they lived to reach it—was a world beyond all worlds... a planet where howling winds could kill and lakes of radium acted as graves.</h3>
